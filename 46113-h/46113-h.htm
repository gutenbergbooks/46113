<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p class="drop">THERE
is a prevalent notion that setting type by hand is not now as
important a part of the printer&rsquo;s vocation as it was years ago.
Ingenious composing machines now perform so much of the work of putting
into printable shape the literature of the world that it is often
assumed the hand compositor&rsquo;s occupation is fast disappearing and does
not offer much inducement for an ambitious young man to follow
seriously. This is a mistaken notion entertained only by those who have
a limited conception of printing craftsmanship and its possibilities for
the exercise of individual skill.</p>

<p>It is true that the greater part of the composition for ordinary
printing is now done by machines, just as in other lines of industry
machines are relieving human hands of the drudgery in large-scale
production by multiplying products through mechanical operations. But
that the work of the hand compositor is any less important now than it
ever has been is far from the fact. Behind the great volume of machine
work, and absolutely essential for any effective use of machine product,
there is greater need than ever before of the hand-work and head-work of
trained compositors.</p>

<p>One of the great defects of machine composition is its lack of
intelligent, trained craftsmanship in typography. Too often it is the
work of machine-thinking operators rather than of intelligent
compositors trained to use the machine to increase their product and
make it of better effect and worth.</p>

<p>Training in hand composition should be a prerequisite for machine
keyboard operation. In no other way can the niceties of typography be so
thoroughly or conveniently learned as with composing stick and type
case.</p>

<p>While hand composition is the particular kind of work the author had in
mind when writing the following pages,

<span class="pagenum"><a href="images/p004.png" name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Page&nbsp;4]</a></span>

many of the instructions and suggestions given apply directly to
machine-set matter. Expertness and correctness are now demanded of all
workmen; correct composition is required from the machine operator even
more insistently than from the hand compositor, since the work of the
former cannot be so readily rectified.</p>

<p>The first and second volumes of this series, &ldquo;Type&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Compositor&rsquo;s Tools,&rdquo; dealing more fully with the tools
and materials used, should be read in connection with this volume.</p>

<h1>TYPESETTING</h1>

<h2 class="secflow"><a name="section_1" id="section_1"></a>Introductory</h2>
</div>
<p class="drop">THE
best and most useful printing is that which has been done by
typography; and the best typography has been, and still is, that done by
type, hand-set and prepared for the press by well-trained compositors.
Good typesetting must be the product of an educated, intelligent mind as
well as a skillful hand. It calls for close attention to practical
details. It demands the exercise of literary and artistic sense which
perceives the requirements of legibility and coherence in thought and
the orderly arrangement of words and lines necessary to make the printed
page of the greatest usefulness.</p>

<p>A composition of movable types has many advantages over other methods of
preparing forms for printing. It offers the readiest means for securing
a page of correct reading matter. The mechanical operations are
relatively simple. No other process will produce so good a printing
surface as quickly or as inexpensively as the typographic method.
Serious faults of the original copy, in spelling, use of points, words,
phrases, in paragraphing, in spacing of lines, in arrangement of
headings, and other errors can be readily corrected in type. The page
can be made longer by leading, or shorter by taking out leads.</p>

<p>Any of these changes can be made with the utmost freedom, in a manner
that is not practicable in any other branch of the graphic arts. The
engraved plate, whether produced by mechanical or by chemical means,
when once made, can be changed only in minor details. What is cut must
stay; any considerable variation from the first impression can be made
only by great skill and by slow processes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a href="images/p008.png" name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Page&nbsp;8]</a></span></p>

<p>Typography is peculiarly the vehicle for printing literature quickly and
effectively. Considering the great influence it can wield, nothing could
be simpler than the tools it employs. An intelligent boy of fifteen
years, after a little practice, can set type and print it with a press,
and the product will be as acceptable as that done by a workman of long
experience.</p>

<p>Yet typesetting is not an occupation easily mastered. To find profit and
satisfaction in the work an apprentice must acquire a broad knowledge of
language and literature and develop an interest in subjects relating to
art and design. Although the mechanics of his work are given the chief
consideration in the following pages, he should remember that his
principal working material is Language and his real tools are alphabets
and words.</p>

<h2 class="sechead"><a name="section_2" id="section_2"></a>Preliminary Suggestions</h2>

<p>There are several habits which the young compositor should begin to
acquire at the outset if he hopes to make his work agreeable and
successful. The mention of these may seem like an unnecessary repetition
of trite injunctions, but in work of the kind upon which he is engaged
their practice is particularly important. The compositor&rsquo;s work is one
of many details, and careless habits quickly lead to unprofitable
results and disappointment. The chief of the good habits may be
enumerated as:</p>

<p>1. The habit of silence while at work. A chattering person in the
composing room is a nuisance.</p>

<p>2. The habit of keeping materials cleared up. A confusion of articles on
the workstand will greatly retard his work. Keep items of the same kind
grouped together as much as possible.</p>

<p>3. The habit of picking up at once type and other articles dropped on
the floor. A type stepped on is spoiled.</p>

<p>4. The habit of not putting anything in the mouth with soiled hands.
Always wash the hands before eating.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a href="images/p009.png" name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Page&nbsp;9]</a></span></p>

<p>5. The habit of standing on both feet and not leaning over the
workstand.</p>

<p>6. The habit of dressing so as to be comfortable and reasonably clean.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img class="noborder w400" src="images/f009.jpg" width="400" height="534" alt="Standing at the case" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;1</p>
</div>

<p>A compositor should stand comfortably on both feet in front of his case,
just a little to the left of the center, and the case should be adjusted
to allow free motion of his right arm over the front of the case. This
will enable him to shift his weight from one foot to the other
occasionally as he reaches from one side

<span class="pagenum"><a href="images/p010.png" name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Page&nbsp;10]</a></span>

of the case to the other. This habit is one that will have to be learned
with some effort, but it will mean much to his health and comfort.</p>

<p>The coat should be removed before beginning work, and the shirt sleeves
should be rolled high enough to avoid interfering with the work on the
galley. A work apron or a loose-fitting coat with short sleeves is
advised in order to protect the front of the usual clothing and to
provide an extra pocket for small articles like tying-up strings,
composing rules, etc. The pocket should not, however, be a depository
for types, leads, or brass rules that are usable; these articles should
be distributed where they belong.</p>

<h2 class="sechead"><a name="section_3" id="section_3"></a>Learning the Case</h2>

<p>There are thirty and more different styles of type cases shown in the
catalogs of dealers in printers&rsquo; supplies, and some of these styles are
made in different sizes. This variety may seem bewildering to the
beginner who sees the case plans and realizes that a compositor must
become familiar with the location of the hundreds of characters in the
many boxes of the various cases.</p>

<p>Many of the case plans shown, however, are not in common use, some of
them never appearing in the average composing room. A number of them are
for special material and their box arrangement is readily understood
when one becomes familiar with composing room work. All unusual cases
are (or should be) marked clearly, with labels on individual boxes if
necessary, showing the name or shape of the character in each box.</p>

<p>The cases used for ordinary hand composition are commonly laid out
according to one of two plans: capital case and lower case. Some cases
are a combination of both these plans. When the apprentice becomes
thoroughly familiar with these two plans and their minor variations

<span class="pagenum"><a href="images/p011.png" name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Page&nbsp;11]</a></span>

he will have little difficulty, if he is observing and careful, in
understanding the arrangement of any other special cases which he may
have to use occasionally.</p>

<p>The plan of the common capital case is a simple alphabetical order of
the letters, with the exception of J and U. The capital case is divided
into two sections, each having seven boxes across and seven boxes in
vertical line&mdash;forty-nine in each half of the case. Of the seven
horizontal rows, only the lower four rows are used for the letters, the
upper boxes being used for miscellaneous characters; or in some cases
left vacant. This arrangement brings the letters AHPX in a vertical
line, then BIQY, and so on, as shown in the
diagram.<span class="fnanchor"><a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1" href="#Footnote_1_1">
<span class="sup">1</span></a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/g011a.jpg">
<img class="noborder w400" src="images/f011a.jpg" width="400" height="204" alt="The capital case" />
</a><p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;(<i>a&nbsp;</i>)</p>
</div>

<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/g011b.jpg">

<p class="footnote3"><span class="label3">
<a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1" href="#FNanchor_1_1">

<span class="smcap">Note.</span>&nbsp;
When the early printers made their case plans I and J, and also
the V and U, were treated as variants of the same symbols and no
special boxes were provided for them in the capital case. Later,
when the J and U were used to express distinctive sounds they
were added to the case in the twenty-fifth and twenty-sixth
places, which explains why they are out of the usual alphabetical
order. The young compositor is advised to read further
information about the history of these letters under their
special heads in any of the unabridged general dictionaries, such
as the Standard, Century, Webster&rsquo;s, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a href="images/p012.png" name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Page&nbsp;12]</a></span></p>

<p>In the lower-case plan there is an irregular arrangement of the
alphabet and a difference in the size of the boxes. Some letters are
used much more frequently than others, and the extra quantities of these
types need larger boxes. These boxes are placed in the case near the
compositor&rsquo;s hand, while the types less frequently used are kept in
boxes farther away.</p>

<p>The pair of upper and lower cases, for many years in use as the standard
cases for book composition and for large roman fonts, is being abandoned
to a great extent. The increasing use of machines for book and
periodical composition during the past few years is gradually
eliminating the double cases which were necessary for large quantities
of type when type was set solely by hand-work. Type cases in pairs are
still generally used, however, and in many composing rooms they hold the
chief working fonts of large as well as small sizes of type. A thorough
familiarity with the box plans of the upper and lower cases should be
the first acquirement of every apprentice.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/g012.jpg">
<img class="noborder w400 pad06top" src="images/f012.jpg" width="400" height="198" alt="The California job case" />
</a><p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;3</p>
</div>

<p>The style of case now commonly used in America is that known as the
California job case, which has boxes for alphabets of both capitals and
small letters and for figures, points, spaces, quads, and a few other
indispensable characters like &amp;, $, dashes, etc. This style of case is
popular because it provides in a convenient single tray enough boxes for
a complete font of types needed to compose English sentences.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a href="images/p013.png" name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Page&nbsp;13]</a></span></p>

<p>The &ldquo;lay of the case&rdquo; may sometimes be learned in a few hours by an
alert boy; sometimes the learning may be a matter of days or even weeks,
according to the opportunity and the quickness of the learner. It is a
good test of the young compositor&rsquo;s mental quality to note the quickness
and accuracy with which he learns this preliminary task. It may be
safely predicted that the boy who works around a composing room for
months doing odd jobs, even if he is not given special permission to set
type, and fails to learn something of the case plan, through lack of
interest or initiative on his part, will not prove an alert, intelligent
compositor later on.</p>

<p>Some foremen instruct the beginner to go to an old case with a composing
stick and hunt for the letters until, by picking and fumbling, he
manages to find those he needs for his first stickful. Another practice
is to place types of a large size in the corners of the boxes of the
principal letters as guides to the unfamiliar small types. Methods of
this kind are slipshod and uncertain; there is sure to be an imperfect
knowledge of the contents of the case, for a time at least, and
consequent mixing of the types.</p>

<p>The best method of learning the case is to draw a plan of it. This can
be done by a study of the case itself before beginning to set type. Let
the apprentice first copy the plan of the boxes without trying to
memorize the letters in them. When the outline of the boxes is complete
the letters can then be marked in place. Another way is to make a copy
on a large scale from a print such as shown on <a href="#Page_11">page&nbsp;11</a>.
When this is done the apprentice should ask the advice of
his foreman or somebody familiar with the cases in his
particular room, to be sure that his plan corresponds with
the cases he will use. Not all cases are laid exactly alike,
even if they appear to be the same at first glance. Many
fonts have peculiar characters, or there may be in the case
types not ordinarily belonging to the

<span class="pagenum"><a href="images/p014.png" name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Page&nbsp;14]</a></span>

font, which are kept in some spare boxes, or for some reason changes may
be desirable in the positions of the regular characters. In this, as in
other matters, a safe rule for the apprentice will be: When in doubt,
ask somebody who knows. It will always be wiser to proceed carefully at
first and know that one is right than to work along in an uncertain,
helter-skelter fashion.</p>

<p>The drawing of plans of the different styles of cases in the room is not
only a good way to learn the cases accurately but is also a good
exercise in the use of pencil and type-measure; it is a simple problem
in mechanical drawing which the young compositor should practice, in
preparation for more advanced &ldquo;layout&rdquo; work which he may do later.</p>

<h2 class="sechead"><a name="section_4" id="section_4"></a>Units for Measuring</h2>

<p>The unit of measurement for types, leads, rules, and other small items
used in composing a page is the <i>point</i>, approximately
<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">72</span> of an inch,
shown by the thickness of this mark:| The most used type bodies are
those of 6-point and others graduated by one point up to 12-point.</p>

<p>The amount of type in a page is measured in ems of the size of type
used. An <i>em</i> is a square of the
body <img src="images/f014.png" width="16" height="16" alt="em-square" />, and varies in size
with each size of type. Thus, an 8-point em is 8&nbsp;points deep and 8&nbsp;points
wide; a 12-point em is 12&nbsp;points deep and 12&nbsp;points wide. The
common method of measuring the quantity of type on a page is by using
the em as the unit, the number of ems in the line being multiplied by
the number of lines on the page. The term em is applied in many ways to
type; the em dash is one cast on a square body, the em fraction is a
fraction cast on a square body, and so with type borders and other
characters.</p>

<p>Before the adoption of the point system type sizes were designated by a
variety of names which were meaningless so far as indicating their sizes
was concerned.

<span class="pagenum"><a href="images/p015.png" name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Page&nbsp;15]</a></span>

In the point system the size of 12-point corresponds to the old pica.
Pica has been a standard type in many countries for a long time, though
it has not always been uniform in size. All type founders made pica
types, but all picas were not the same size in this country until after
the adoption of the point system in 1887. The old names pica and
nonpareil (half pica, or 6-point) still survive as convenient terms to
use in naming these sizes.</p>

<p>For convenience and economy in the composing room the leads, slugs,
rules, metal and wooden furniture, wood type, and other composing
material are used in lengths graduated by 12-point or pica. When leads
or rules are spoken of as being twenty picas, or twenty ems, it is
understood that they are twenty 12-points long. Pica gages are scales
marked off in units of 12-point (and half, or 6-point). A graduated
composing stick is made to set to measures of 12-point and half.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that the point size was given as approximately
<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">72</span>
of an inch. Actually a point is .013837 of an inch, but for
convenience the simpler fraction of
<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">72</span>
is sufficiently accurate for
composing-room purposes. This makes the 12-point or pica
<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">6</span>
of an inch.
Shop custom measures the items of a page in points, and the page itself
or its chief divisions by picas. Paper, sizes and other large dimensions
are measured in inches.</p>

<p>It is important for the apprentice to learn these units of measurements
and their relation to each other in order to make quick calculations for
line lengths, page sizes, margins, etc.</p>

</div>

<p>Trade custom gives the name <i>spaces</i> to the small type blanks and
<i>quads</i> to the larger type blanks. These are further specified according
to their thickness or fractional part of the em, or square, as 3-to-em,

4-to-em, 5-to-em (hereafter in this treatise, for convenience, termed
respectively the 3-space, 4-space, 5-space). Very thin blanks are hair
spaces or justifiers. The en quad (half the square) is sometimes called
the thick space.<span class="fnanchor"><a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2" href="#Footnote_2_2">
<span class="sup">2</span></a></span>
The large blanks are the em quad 2-em quad, and (for types of 12-point
and smaller) 3-em quad.</p>

<p>To the beginner the difference between some spaces and quads is not
always clear because of the frequent identity of size in different type
bodies. Thus, a 3-space of an 18-point font is 18&times;6 points, which is the
same as a 3-em quad of 6-point. The difference between the two is in the
position of the nicks (except where spaces and quads are cast without
nicks). On the 6-point quad the nick is along the 3-em side, while on
the 18-point space it is across the narrow 6-point edge. The identity in
size is often a convenience, when quads or spaces of one size are
exhausted, by allowing the use of pieces from another font.</p>

<p>The apprentice should become familiar with these regular spaces of his
case at the outset. He may learn to distinguish them by putting one of
each thickness side by side frequently for comparison. By doing this
with each size of type as he comes to use it he will soon learn to
distinguish the spaces at a glance, to select quickly the space he
wants, and to sort them properly in distributing.</p>

<p>These four regular thickness of spaces meet most of the requirements of
type composition. Besides their own individual widths they may be
combined into any other widths for spacing and justifying lines. The
following table,

<span class="pagenum"><a href="images/p017.png" name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Page&nbsp;17]</a></span>

showing twenty-four different widths less than the em which can be made
with the four original spaces, should be studied by the beginner who is
in despair because he cannot find just the right thickness to fit his
line.</p>

<span class="smcap">Note.</span>&nbsp;
The 3-space is often miscalled the thick space; but
as it is commonly known as the normal space (i.e. neither thick nor
thin) it seems illogical to call it also a thick space. The en quad or
any space thicker than the 3-space is obviously a thick space.</p>

<h2 class="sechead"><a name="section_6" id="section_6"></a>A Simple Spacing Table</h2>

<p>Taking 60 as the common denominator of the five blanks, including the em
quad, which would be

the en quad is

<p>With a supply of the regular spaces at hand it will be seen that for
average work there is ample opportunity for careful spacing and proper
justification. The trouble often comes, however, because of an
insufficient supply of the thinner spaces. Unfortunately in many places
these are not supplied in right quantities and the usual boxes for
holding them are inadequate for a proper supply. Improper distribution
of the thin spaces is also responsible for the lack of a proper supply,
as well as for great loss of time in sorting and hunting during
composition.</p>

<p>The point system of widths has been applied to spaces, the thickness
being graduated by points and half-points, instead of the fractional
division of the em. In a font of 10-point, for instance, the four
ordinary spaces 5-space, 4-space, 3-space, and en quad, are

<span class="pagenum"><a href="images/p018.png" name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Page&nbsp;18]</a></span>

respectively 2,
2<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>,
3<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">3</span>,
and 5 points thick. In the point system
there are five spaces within these limits, namely: 2,
2<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>,
3, 4, and 5&nbsp;points
thick. The extra space and two intermediate widths between the
4-space and the en quad give many advantages in spacing for good
composition; though as yet the use of these point-width spaces is not
general in hand composition. The lack of proper boxes to keep them in
the ordinary type cases is a serious drawback to their economical use.</p>

<p>The following table shows the widths of point spaces in six common sizes
of type:</p>

<p>When type composition is to be used regularly for making moulds for
electrotypes; high spaces, quads, leads, and slugs are employed instead
of the ordinary low spaces and quads. These reach nearly as high as the
shoulder of the type and, unlike low spaces, do not leave small holes
and crevices between the words and lines into which the moulding wax is
forced when moulding. Although a great deal of miscellaneous job work is
moulded for electrotyping with low spaces and other blanks, the
electrotyper finds it difficult to obtain the best results with forms
made up in this manner. The high blank spaces make a better moulding
form and are used in composing rooms where the major part of the work is
electrotyped.</p>

<p>Large hollow quads, known as quotation quads (quotation furniture, in
the larger sizes), are used in place of solid quads where there are many
large blanks in the form. These have the advantage of lightness

<span class="pagenum"><a href="images/p019.png" name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Page&nbsp;19]</a></span>

in comparison with regular quads. They should be set in the form with
the hollow space down, so as not to catch dirt and small particles that
will be likely to come out later on the ink rollers when the form is on
the press. There are occasionally places where it will be an advantage
to use them hollow-side up for ease in picking them out when changing
the form; but the form should never be sent to press or to the
electrotype foundry with the hollow spaces up.</p>

<p>In a font of typewriter type all characters are cast on bodies of the
same width. Only one kind of space is used (or need be used) for spacing
the lines. This space is the same width as the letters, so that each
line contains exactly the same number of pieces. The usual size for this
kind of type is 12-point and the width of the letters and the space is a
little more than the en. The apprentice should notice that the 12-point
typewriter space and the 12-point en quad are not the same.</p>

<p>Script types usually need spaces and quads that are beveled on two sides
near the top. The bevels are to allow for the overhanging kern of the
letters. The spaces and quads are cast to fit the particular design of
the face.</p>

<p>The general practice of slug-casting machine composition is to justify
the lines by <i>increasing</i> the spaces, which explains the customary
wide-spaced appearance of machine-set matter. As the same space-bands
are used for all sizes on the machine, a 6-point size is spaced
relatively much wider than a 10-point face.</p>

<div class="footnote2 pad05top"><p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&nbsp;
The system of spaces here considered is that of regular
foundry type fonts. Linotypes and Monotypes have systems of spacing
which differ considerably from this. In Monotype composition a
special unit system is used. There are 18&nbsp;units in a quad, which,
unlike the em quad of foundry type, in the smaller sizes is not
usually an exact square. The space is 6&nbsp;units, approximating the
foundry 3-to-em space; the 5-unit space equaling the 4-to-em space;
and the 4-unit usually a little less than the 5-to-em space. These
are cast from matrices and represent fixed widths. But in the
process of composition the expanding or justifying space is used to
fill out the

<span class="pagenum"><a href="images/p020.png" name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Page&nbsp;20]</a></span>

line. When the keyboard operator sees that another word or syllable can
not go into the line the keys indicating the width of the spaces to fill
the line are struck, the result being that all spaces are spread equally
to fill the line. The actual spaces cast may be any number of units in
width.</p>

<p>On the Linotype there are three fixed spaces: the em quad, the en
quad (or figure space), and the thin space, equal to a fourth of
the em. The regular space is made by space-bands which can be used
to make any size between a 3-to-em and double this thickness. If
anything smaller than the thin space is needed, it must be put in
by hand.</p></div>

<p class="toclink"><a href="#CONTENTS">Table of Contents</a></p>

<h2 class="sechead"><a name="section_7" id="section_7"></a>Hair Spaces and Justifiers</h2>

<p>The term <i>justifying</i> refers to the tightening of a line to make it
correspond with other lines or parts of the page, so that the whole form
may be locked together compactly, with no parts loose and none too
tight. The term <i>spacing</i> refers to the blanks between the words in the
lines. The term <i>leading</i> refers to the distance between the lines in a
paragraph or page of plain matter.</p>

<p>A line of type may be well spaced but improperly justified. On the other
hand, it may be badly spaced but nicely justified.</p>

<p>There are many places where spaces thinner than the 5-space are needed,
especially for letter-spacing and for careful word-spacing, as well as
for tabular pages and other work requiring accurate justification. For
such purposes hair spaces, copper-thins, and brass-thins are provided.
The thickness of hair spaces varies according to the size of the type;
the name is given generally to any cast space thinner than the 5-to-em.
Copper spaces are <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>-point
in thickness and brass spaces are 1-point
thick, the difference in the metal used being for easy distinction of
the thicknesses. Copper and brass spaces, because of greater durability,
are superior to cast metal hair spaces for hand composition.</p>

<p>When metal thin spaces are not at hand it may be necessary to resort to
pieces of paper or thin card. Spaces of this kind should be used only in
exceptional cases and not at all as a common practice. There

<span class="pagenum"><a href="images/p021.png" name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Page&nbsp;21]</a></span>

should be never more than a few pieces of paper used in justifying a
line. A safe rule for the apprentice, when he thinks he cannot make his
line come right without some such expedient, is to ask an experienced
compositor, who will usually show him how to justify without the paper.</p>

<h2 class="sechead"><a name="section_8" id="section_8"></a>Leads and Slugs</h2>

<p>Lines of type are separated by leads and slugs. These are strips of
metal lower than type-high and are furnished by dealers in labor-saving
fonts and also in lengths of two feet. Leads are made 1-point,
1<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>-point,
2-point, and 3-point thick. The 1-point size is furnished
in 16-inch lengths. The 2-point is the thickness mostly used. Slugs are
made usually 6-point, 12-point, 18-point, and 24-point thick, but other
sizes are also made.</p>

<p>Leads and slugs are made in two heights; one slightly less than low
spaces and quads, for usual composition when the type is to be used for
printing, and the other high enough to reach the shoulder of the type,
for use with high spaces and quads in electrotype moulding.</p>

<p>Leads and slugs are also made of brass, in sizes, lengths, and heights
similar to the soft metal varieties. While the cost of brass material is
much greater than ordinary metal strips, in some cases its greater
durability makes it more economical. This is true of the 1-point and
1<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>-point
thicknesses used in standard lengths, as in newspaper and
periodical pages. For occasional use in job work the soft metal leads
are usually satisfactory.</p>

<p>Strips of wood, called reglet, are sometimes used as substitutes for
leads and slugs in large sizes.<a id="tn2_1" name="tn2_1"></a>
These are made in lengths of one yard
and in sizes of 6-point (nonpareil), 12-point (pica), and 18-point.
Larger sizes of the same material are known as wooden furniture.</p>

<p>All the material mentioned under this head is commonly used in lengths
graduated by the pica (12-point)

<span class="pagenum"><a href="images/p022.png" name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Page&nbsp;22]</a></span>

and is for the most part in labor-saving fonts or assortments. Each kind
should be kept, when not in use, in racks or cases with compartments for
the different lengths.</p>

<h2 class="sechead"><a name="section_9" id="section_9"></a>Setting the Composing Stick</h2>

<p>The width of a type page is called its <i>measure</i>. Before commencing to
set type the stick must be set to the measure required; that is, for the
length of the type line. If the stick is of the modern graduated pattern
which sets to standard measures by changing the movable side-piece to a
slot or notch where it is fixed, the setting is a simpler matter. These
sticks will no doubt be in more common use later than they are now
because of their many advantages; but as there are many of the old style
thumbscrew sticks (especially the kind known as the Yankee job stick) in
use in composing rooms throughout the country, it is necessary to know
how to adjust these correctly. The old style sticks not only require
care in setting but watchfulness afterward to see that they do not
change while being used for a job.</p>

<p>The manner of setting a stick may depend upon the kind of work to be
done. For job work of a few lines only, where the lines are to be locked
by themselves in a chase, the stick may be set by a bunch of leads of
the required length. These are placed in the stick and the movable knee
set up to them loosely, so that the leads do not bind at the ends. If
the job is to be enclosed in a border or rule panel the stick should be
adjusted accurately to ems of 12-point or 6-point.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img class="noborder w400" src="images/f023a.jpg" width="400" height="123" alt="The Composing Stick" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;5</p>
</div>

<p>For ordinary measures a line of perfect 12-point quads will be a good
gage. For very short measures, as in tabular column heads, 6-point quads
should be used. A gage that will be more uniformly accurate is a line of
12-point letters (for short measures) or 24-point letters (for longer
measures) from a font of foundry-cast

<span class="pagenum"><a href="images/p023.png" name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Page&nbsp;23]</a></span>

type. These should be set in the stick with the nicks sideways, not in
front as for composition. The body-size of cast type is the most
accurate of any point-size material, and as 12-point and 24-point fonts
are at hand in every composing room they furnish a convenient and
reliable standard at all times.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img class="noborder w400" src="images/f023b.png" width="400" height="40" alt="A row of twenty sideways ems" />
</div>

<p>Usually the knee should be set lightly against the gage when the
thumbscrew is tightened. A good plan is to put a slip of paper at one
end of the line of quads or letters (See A, Fig.&nbsp;5), and to push up the
knee firmly. A line of many separate types will not fit together as
solidly as a line of a few quads; to allow for a little compression in
the line when it is locked up later the slight fullness is given in
setting the stick. In setting measures for tabular columns and for very
short lines the slip of paper is not necessary.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img class="noborder w300" src="images/f023c.jpg" width="300" height="157" alt="The Composing Stick" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;6</p>
</div>

<p>It is important that the outer end of the knee should be kept at a right
angle to make the stick square, in order that the first and last lines
of the stickful should be of exactly the same length. If there is any
doubt

<span class="pagenum"><a href="images/p024.png" name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Page&nbsp;24]</a></span>

about this, test the front of the stick by moving the gage line forward
when the measure is adjusted. If <a id="the" name="the"></a>the gage line is looser here than
at the back, the outer end of the knee may be closed in by inserting a
piece of card between the knee and the back plate, as is shown at A in
Fig.&nbsp;6.</p>

<p>When the measure is set, make the thumbscrew as tight as possible with
the fingers. <i>Do not use a wrench</i>, as this is liable to give
unnecessary force and break the small clamp.</p>

<p>Make it a practice to try the thumbscrew occasionally while using the
stick to prevent the knee from becoming loose, as it may in case the
lines are justified tightly.</p>

<h2 class="sechead"><a name="section_10" id="section_10"></a>Use of the Composing Rule</h2>

<p>Lines of type are easier handled by the aid of a composing rule. It is
not practicable to set small types in the stick without some support or
to set a second line immediately next to another without a lead or rule
to separate them. The composing rule furnishes a smooth surface against
which to place the types as they are assembled and to keep them in line
while the respacing and justifying is done. The rule is also convenient
for lifting lines out into the galley and for handling them in later
operations.</p>

<p>Sets of these rules can be purchased from supply houses or they may be
made from a discarded strip of brass rule (2-point or 3-point), by
trimming one end so as to leave a nib 10&nbsp;points long.</p>

<p>Composing rules are not used now as much as formerly, owing to the fact
that hand composition is largely in the nature of job work. A compositor
in a day sets a great variety of line-lengths, many of them in large
types, and he dispenses with the composing rule as a needless tool,
using instead the ready-at-hand leads and slugs needed for the page. In
many cases this is advisable. Yet when there are many lines of one
length to

<span class="pagenum"><a href="images/p025.png" name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Page&nbsp;25]</a></span>

set and to correct and later to make up into pages, the composing rule
is recommended as a useful accessory.</p>

<h2 class="sechead"><a name="section_11" id="section_11"></a>Setting Type</h2>

<p>With a correct plan of the case before him the beginner at typesetting
may go at his work with confidence that one part of his work is
simplified and he can devote his attention to the next steps, that is,
to learn to hold the stick comfortably and to pick up the types and put
them in line.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img class="noborder w400" src="images/f024.jpg" width="400" height="168" alt="Holding the Composing Stick" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;7</p>
</div>

<p>The accompanying illustration shows the manner of holding the stick.
Notice that it is held in the left hand, leaving the right hand free to
pick up the letters. Type must be set right-handedly even by left-handed
persons. The types are placed in the left corner of the stick with the
nicks outward, and each type as it is placed is held gently by the thumb
of the left hand.</p>

<p>The stick is always held with the open side slightly tilted up to allow
the types to lie against the composing rule, and the left thumb follows
each type along the line to keep it from falling out of place.</p>

<p>The beginner will usually try to read his first words in type by turning
the stick so that the bottom of the line is toward him. This is not the
way experienced compositors do, however. The printer reads his type
lines up-side-down, with the top of the line toward him. In this way he
reads the lines from left to right, just as he would the printed page
except that the top of the type page is nearest to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a href="images/p026.png" name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Page&nbsp;26]</a></span></p>

<p>It must be remembered that any printing form is the reverse of the
printed sheet. The simplest way is to reverse the page from top to
bottom rather than from right to left. Just turn this page face down on
the table and you can readily imagine what the types that printed it
would look like.</p>

<p>A compositor should always read his copy ahead of his setting and try to
get the sense of the words. This will make it easier for him to carry in
his mind a number of words at a time in advance of picking up the types.
One who must constantly refer to his copy word for word will waste
valuable time hunting for his place, will have greater difficulty in
keeping the sequence of words, and will be far more liable to make
mistakes. Concentration of mind is absolutely essential if he hopes to
become a good compositor.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;8</p>
</div>

<p>The nicks on the type bodies are important in helping to pick them up in
such a manner that they may be carried to the stick and put in place
right side up quickly. Look for a particular type in the box and note
the nick first. Select one that can be carried to the stick right side
up with the fewest motions. While it is going to its place look for the
next type and have the left thumb in the stick do its share of the team
work. Fumbling for a type, picking it up and turning it over several
times to find the nick before it can be put in the line is a habit that
should be guarded against as a positive handicap. Study to avoid as much
as possible all superfluous motions. Do not mistake nervous, fussy,
trust-to-luck motions for speed; they are usually

<span class="pagenum"><a href="images/p027.png" name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Page&nbsp;27]</a></span>

the reverse. Be deliberate and accurate, even if slow at the start.
Learn first to do it right, then strive to do it quickly. Speed is
important, but correctness is much more so.</p>

<h2 class="sechead"><a name="section_12" id="section_12"></a>Justifying the Lines</h2>

<p>Each line of type must end with a completed word or a syllable. When the
line is first set, however, it rarely happens that the types fill the
line snugly without more or less changing of the spaces. If a little
more room is needed to take in the last letter or two of a word, the
spaces are changed for thinner ones until the word is brought in. On the
other hand, if there remains a little space after the last word or
syllable, the spaces are increased a little until the line is full. Just
when to thin space and bring in a word or syllable or when to fill out
the line with wider spaces depends upon whether the composition
generally is to be thin spaced or is to be wide spaced.</p>

<p>Changing the spaces is done by pushing the top of the space from between
the words with the one that is to be inserted in its place. The new
space is dropped in and the old one picked out and put in the case where
it belongs, the thumb in the stick meanwhile keeping the line from
falling. Changing the spaces in this manner should be done with care in
order to avoid injuring the face of adjoining types.</p>

<p>Another method of changing spaces is to lift up the wrong space by an
upward pressure of the left thumb and pick it out with the right thumb
and forefinger, afterward inserting the new space.</p>

<p>A line of type is well justified when it will stand up in the stick
without other support than its own tightness. Lines that will fall down
when the composing stick is slightly tipped forward are too loosely
justified. On the other hand, they should not be so tight that they will
be difficult to lift out when the stickful is taken out on the galley.
Unnecessary tightness is

<span class="pagenum"><a href="images/p028.png" name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Page&nbsp;28]</a></span>

liable to injure small types at the end of the lines. Careless
compositors will sometimes force a type into place so tightly that it
will shave a slight film of metal from the adjoining types, the metal
remaining under the feet of the letters which will make them higher than
the surrounding letters.</p>

<p>Long lines require a little firmer justification than short ones,
because the greater number of pieces, especially if the type is old,
will compress more than the fewer number in the short line when they are
later locked up in the chase.</p>

<p>Leads and brass rules should not be so long that they bind tightly when
they are placed in the measure. When this happens the type lines near
them will rarely lock up tight without very great pressure in the chase.</p>

<p>The beginner at composition is not at first apt to realize the
importance of careful justification. It is not till later when he must
lock up the types for printing that he learns why they must be exactly
upright to give the proper impression and carefully fitted together to
hold solidly in the form.</p>

<p>The first point to note is that the types should be squarely on their
feet in the stick when the line is justified. If they are leaning
forward or backward and left this way the line will be short when the
types are later straightened up on the galley or in the form. It is
wise, therefore, before going to the next line to make sure that all
types are on their feet when the final letter or justifying space is
inserted.</p>

<h2 class="sechead"><a name="section_13" id="section_13"></a>Emptying the Stick</h2>

<p>For the first few stickfuls, until the apprentice learns how to handle
the lines without <i>pi</i>-ing, leads should be put between all the lines in
the stick, even if they are to be taken out later to print the type as
solid matter. A lead should be put at the top of the first line and
after the last line in the stick. If a composing

<span class="pagenum"><a href="images/p029.png" name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Page&nbsp;29]</a></span>

rule is used, this may or may not be kept with the lines. Many
compositors insert the composing rule at the top of the first line while
lifting the lines out of the stick, as the rule gives a good surface by
which to take hold of the matter.</p>

<p>It is a good plan not to fill the stick too full before emptying. A few
lines at first will be enough to practice with, until the knack of
grasping the matter all around and lifting out is acquired.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img class="noborder w400" src="images/f029a.jpg" width="400" height="243" alt="Emptying the Composing Stick" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;9</p>
</div>

<p>The galley should be placed on the case or on an adjoining stand or
inclined support, with the head turned toward the right. If the lines
have been properly justified, there is no need to open the measure of
the stick to extricate lines that seem very tight. In this case take out
the lines separately, but keep the measure unchanged till the work is
done.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/g029b.jpg">
<img class="noborder w400" src="images/f029b.jpg" width="400" height="184" alt="The galley on the case" />
</a><p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;10</p>
</div>

<p>The stick is emptied in the following manner, as

<span class="pagenum"><a href="images/p030.png" name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Page&nbsp;30]</a></span>

illustrated in the accompanying diagram: Lay the stick near the bottom
of the galley, with the top line or back of the stick at the lower rim
of the galley. The two forefingers are then placed in the stick after
the last line and the two thumbs beside the top line. The second
fingers, doubled up, are pressed against the ends of the lines at both
sides. Thus holding the lines evenly all around, the top lines are
lifted slightly with a turning motion to bring the feet of the type
upward. This gives a chance for the thumbs to get a better hold down
beside the top line. The small fingers are meanwhile holding the stick
down against the upward motion of the matter, while the lines are taken
out. The types should then be held in a horizontal position, while the
compositor turns his right side to the galley. Still holding the lines
firmly, he next turns them feet down in the lower corner, with the
beginning of the lines at the lower rim. (Do not release hold until the
matter is close against the rim of the galley, keeping the middle
fingers at the ends of lines to prevent any types from dropping out of
place. If any types should drop, take hold of the handful again and move
it farther down the galley, pick up the loose type and then slide the
lines to the head of the galley and insert the missing type.)</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img class="noborder w400" src="images/f030.jpg" width="400" height="175" alt="Holding the lines of types" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;11</p>
</div>

<p>When first placed on the galley the type is liable to be a little off
its feet. Have a piece of good metal furniture 8&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;20 picas to place
beside the lines, first at the bottom and then at the ends of the lines,
and use this to square up the types on their feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a href="images/p031.png" name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Page&nbsp;31]</a></span></p>

<p>An untrained compositor is prone to use more thin spaces than are
necessary, and he quickly finds that there are not enough in the case to
meet his wants. He puts in extra thin spaces to fill out the line
instead of changing the spaces already in for thicker ones. He inserts
5-spaces beside 3-spaces through the line because this appears the
easiest way, though in the end it is neither the quickest nor the best
way. When wide spacing is necessary it is usually better to change the
3-spaces for en quads, and if the line does not then quite justify to
put double spaces between long words or those having tall letters.
Obviously it is not wise to put in two 4-spaces when there is a
plentiful supply of en quads at hand. By using two thin spaces where one
thick space will suffice the supply of thin spaces is soon exhausted,
while there will be an over-supply of the thicker kinds left in the
case.<a id="tn2_2" name="tn2_2"></a>
It often happens that the same kind of composition is set by an
experienced workman with half the number of thin spaces used by a novice
and it will show greater uniformity in spacing and justification.</p>

<p>Combinations of 3 5-spaces, 3 4-spaces, or 4 5-spaces should be used
sparingly, and only when they are needed to justify the line. Two
3-spaces together are better than an en quad and a 5-space. There are
usually more 3-spaces in the case, and they are easier to distribute
than the thinner spaces.</p>

<p>A good general rule is never to use two or more pieces of material where
one piece will suffice.</p>

<h2 class="sechead"><a name="section_14" id="section_14"></a>Tying Up the Page</h2>

<p>When the composed lines are on the galley ready for proving they must be
fastened temporarily. A column of type is placed on a long narrow galley
in which a side-stick of wood is laid beside the lines. This is held in
place by pushing in a few wooden wedges or quoins. The Hempel style of
metal quoins are well adapted for this purpose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a href="images/p032.png" name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Page&nbsp;32]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img class="noborder w400" src="images/f032.jpg" alt="Starting to tie up the page" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;12</p>
</div>

<p>When the composition is relatively small the lines are usually tied up
with a cord. This is done by winding the cord several times around the
matter, the number of turns depending upon the size of the page and the
stoutness of the cord. Printers&rsquo; supply houses call this string page
cord. There is no standard thickness or brand. Any good cotton cord can
be used. That which is known among twine dealers as Seine No.&nbsp;12 is
excellent for this purpose. Start the cord at the left top corner of the
matter as it lies on the galley&mdash;that is, usually at the end of the last
line. With the left hand hold an inch or less of the cord while the
right hand winds it along the upper side, around the head, and down the
lower side of the matter close to the rim of the galley, then back to
the starting point. Here the cord is crossed over the first end so as to
bind it, each turn of the cord at this point going below the preceding
one. At the end of the cord turn in a loop just around the corner,
pushing the cord between the types and the windings with the nib-end of
the composing rule. Draw the loop up reasonably tight so that it will
not slip out, and leave a short end out, to be found later when
necessary to take the cord off. Hold the left hand on the page until the
end of the cord is made fast, to avoid any unexpected movement of the
page during the operation. When the page is fastened, move it a little
from the lower rim of the galley and push the cords down to the middle
of the

<span class="pagenum"><a href="images/p033.png" name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Page&nbsp;33]</a></span>

type-height, especially if low leads, spaces, and quads are used in the
matter. When the cord is tight around the upper part of the type there
is liability of the page doubling up when it is pushed off to the
imposing table or the proof press.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img class="noborder w400 pad1top" src="images/f033.jpg" width="400" height="205" alt="The fastened page" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;13</p>
</div>

<p>If the galley has a high rim there may be some difficulty in getting the
cord down over the lead at the top line and along the lower edge. In
this case, when the first complete turn of the cord is made move the
page carefully up on the galley so that the second and succeeding
windings may come under the first one.</p>

<p>Do not leave long ends of the cord hanging out, as they are liable to
get under the feet of the type and cause damage when the proof is made.</p>

<p>Special care should be taken to keep the feet of the type free from dirt
or lumps of any kind. A good practice of many compositors, after tying
up pages that are not too large to allow it, is to lift the page
perpendicularly and hold it in the left hand while the bottom is brushed
off with the right hand, and then to wipe off the surface of the press
or imposing table before laying the page down.</p>

<p>In composing rooms where a great deal of job composition is done the
time spent in tying up pages is considerable, and the work is often done
carelessly. Each compositor should have at hand his own supply of

<span class="pagenum"><a href="images/p034.png" name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Page&nbsp;34]</a></span>

page cords, kept in orderly manner for instant use. A ball of stout
white twine every week or oftener costs much less than the time spent in
a week to hunt for pieces of cords kept in no particular place. An
assortment of the lengths most used, folded into little skeins and kept
in the apron pocket, will save time and trouble. Avoid the pieced-up,
knotted string around a page of type that is to be placed on the
imposing table for locking up. Leave no long loose ends, but make the
fastening loop so that it can be readily found after the furniture is
placed around the page.</p>

<p>Stout new rubber bands of the right length may be used for tying up
pages and jobs, but they must be managed carefully, especially in taking
off, to avoid squabbling the type. They are suitable only for temporary
tie-ups and should not be used if the pages are to be kept standing many
days.</p>

<h2 class="sechead"><a name="section_15" id="section_15"></a>Taking Proofs</h2>

<p>First proofs from composed types are taken for the purpose of correcting
any errors. Later proofs are for verifying corrections and to note
whether instructions have been followed in make-up and in various other
matters necessary to get the type ready for printing.</p>

<p>Proofs are sometimes taken by using a proof planer and mallet, but more
commonly by means of a proof press.</p>

<p>In any of the usual methods employed it is first necessary to spread ink
on the type face with an ink roller. A small hand roller is used in
combination with a smooth steel or stone surface on which to distribute
the ink. The composition of the roller should be well seasoned and the
roller should be well cleaned. A good grade of slow-drying black ink of
the quality known as &ldquo;book&rdquo; ink is necessary for the usual work. A very
thin ink or a very stiff ink is not suitable. The amount used should be
just enough to give a clear

<span class="pagenum"><a href="images/p035.png" name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Page&nbsp;35]</a></span>

impression of the type, and no more. This is graduated to the lightness
or boldness of the face, and also to the finish of the paper. A glossy
coated paper will need less ink than a machine-finish paper; while an
antique-finish paper will need much more ink than either. As a general
rule, proofs are made on smooth-finish paper with a minimum quantity of
moderately stiff ink.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;15. Proof Planer and Mallet in use</p>
</div>

<p>A proof planer is a block of wood about 8&nbsp;inches long by
3<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>&nbsp;inches
wide and
2<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>&nbsp;inches
high, having its face covered with a piece of
thick cloth or felt. A planer proof must be made while the type is on
the imposing stone or some other solid surface. When ink has been rolled
on the type a sheet of thin paper, slightly damp, is laid on the type
and the planer is used for taking the impression. The sheet should be
dampened evenly all over with a sponge, enough to be a little limp. The
unsponged side of the sheet is laid on the type very carefully to avoid
slurring the impression. The proof planer, held in the left hand, is
placed steadily on top, and a mallet in the right hand is used to tap
the planer. If the planer does not cover the whole page, it must be
lifted from one part to another

<span class="pagenum"><a href="images/p036.png" name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Page&nbsp;36]</a></span>

until the whole surface is covered. This requires some practice, to
avoid a shifting of the sheet on the type and making a double or smeared
impression.</p>

<p>A firm foundation for the type and a steady blow, graduated in force to
the size of the printing surface, are necessary for a clean impression.
The mallet should hit straight, without glancing sidewise, and the
planer should be held level and steady.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/g036.jpg">
<img class="noborder w400" src="images/f036.jpg" width="400" height="467" alt="A Proof Press" />
</a><p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;16</p>
</div>

<p>The kind of type forms adapted for proving by this method are those with
paragraphs of plain matter and strong faces which will not be easily
battered. Those with large open spaces and small lines, and those with
delicate lines like scripts and kerned italic letters, should not be
proved with a planer if another method is available. Small groups of
type standing alone, like page numbers and small imprints, require very
careful treatment in proving, to avoid unnecessary impression which may
batter the face or break off the kerns. When it becomes necessary to
take proofs of fine or small types standing without surrounding

<span class="pagenum"><a href="images/p037.png" name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Page&nbsp;37]</a></span>

support, it is a good plan to place near the type, on two sides if
possible, type-high blocks upon which the planer may rest while the
impression is being tapped.</p>

<p>The proof planer is not the common method of taking proofs, but is
employed in places where there is no regular proof press, and also under
conditions where a proof press cannot readily be used. The latter
condition is in the case of a large form beyond the capacity of the
proof press, locked up on the imposing stone, when a proof is required,
either of a part or of the whole, for verification of some detail before
sending the form to press for printing.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img class="noborder w400" src="images/f037.jpg" width="464" height="506" alt="A Proof Planer" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;17</p>
</div>

<p>The other and more common method of taking proofs is on one or another
of the several kinds of proof presses, as described in text-book No.&nbsp;5
of this series, &ldquo;Proof Presses,&rdquo; to which the reader is referred for a
detailed consideration of the subject.</p>

<h2 class="sechead"><a name="section_16" id="section_16"></a>Making Corrections</h2>

<p>When a line of type has been set in the composing stick it should be
read over with care, compared with copy, and any mistakes corrected
before the line is justified. A habit of doing this will make cleaner
proofs and save a great deal of time and expense. An error

<span class="pagenum"><a href="images/p038.png" name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Page&nbsp;38]</a></span>

corrected at this time saves a second justification of the line. If the
error is an omitted word or syllable or a word inserted twice its
detection will save the probable over-running of several lines or even
of a whole paragraph later.</p>

<p>The lines should also be scanned before being taken from the stick to
the galley. A turned letter or a wrong type overlooked in the first
examination may be changed by lifting the line a little until the type
can be picked out and the right one put in its place.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/g038.jpg">
<img class="noborder w400" src="images/f038.jpg" width="400" height="547" alt="Checking lines at the case" />
</a><p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;18</p>
</div>

<p>Do not try to correct a line in the stick when another line or part of a
line is in front of it. If a correction makes necessary a change of
spaces or a re-justifying of the line, take out all the lines in front,
then correct and justify again. This allows the stick to be held in the
hand and the types can be handled in the same

<span class="pagenum"><a href="images/p039.png" name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Page&nbsp;39]</a></span>

manner as for the original setting. This will be more convenient than to
lay the stick on the case while re-spacing a line in the middle of a
stickful.</p>

<p>The use of a bodkin or tweezers is seldom necessary for correcting in
the stick or on the galley, unless the type is very small and the
measure is narrow.</p>

<p>A little care in revising the lines as they are set, before the first
proof is taken, will result in cleaner proofs and will reduce the time
for proofreading as well as for later corrections.</p>

<p>Even though the lines have been carefully revised while being set,
errors of various kinds will probably be marked on the proof when it
comes back from the proofreader. If there are many lines and a number of
serious errors the corrections are made at the case. The galley is
placed at one side of the case if possible, rather than on top of the
case, with the head of the galley and the top of the lines toward the
right. When only one stand can be used it may be well to put the type
case in the rack under the working shelf and to put the galley on the
shelf. This will permit free access to the case for the letters needed
in correcting and will give a good resting place for the galley and
composing stick.</p>

<p>The compositor stands with his right side to the galley and works with
the tops of the lines toward him. The composing rule with a nib is
useful at this time. Lines in which corrections are to be made should
have leads or rules beside them to help keep them from <i>pi</i>-ing during
the operation. If the lines are set solid, leads or rules should be
inserted temporarily and taken out when the correcting is finished.</p>

<p>Simple errors like the exchanging of one type for another of the same
width, the turning of an inverted character, or the transposition of
letters or words, are corrected by pressing the line at both ends to
lift it up about one-third of its height and picking out the wrong types
with the finger and thumb. The line is then dropped in place and the
right types put in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a href="images/p040.png" name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Page&nbsp;40]</a></span></p>

<p>A line in which there is a change of the spaces or of the justification
should be lifted into a composing stick of the right measure for
correction. Any important change in a line of type should always be made
in a stick, where accurate justification is most readily secured. First
place the composing stick conveniently at hand, with its back toward the
compositor. Insert the composing rule down at the top of the line in the
galley, press both ends of the line together, and raise it up gently;
when it is clear of the other lines turn it so that the rule is under,
and then transfer to the stick. As a rule, lines of type should be
carried in a position which keeps the types themselves horizontal, not
perpendicular. In this manner they are supported by the lead or rule
underneath. If carried with the feet of the types down they are liable
to drop out unless perfectly justified and firmly held.</p>

<p>Many careless compositors persist in correcting lines on the galley in a
puttering, botchy manner which results in badly justified lines. The
beginner is usually inclined to do the same thing because he has not yet
learned to perform with ease and safety the trick of transferring lines
back and forth from the galley to the stick. Instead of shirking this
operation because it looks difficult, he should practice it until he can
do it safely and quickly. A compositor who does not justify his lines
properly is rated as a careless workman. If he has nothing to do with
the later locking up of the forms for the foundry or the press he is
prone to slight this part of his work and thus make additional duties
for other workmen, as well as increase the risk of subsequent error or
accident.</p>

<p>Corrections in type matter often call for the over-running of the lines;
that is, the words must be taken from one line to another, requiring
changes in other lines beside the one in which the correction was
marked. This procedure takes time and is costly. It means

<span class="pagenum"><a href="images/p041.png" name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Page&nbsp;41]</a></span>

that the entire matter thus re-arranged must be revised to see that new
errors have not crept in.</p>

<p>There are two ways of handling the lines for over-running. When a few
lines are to be thus changed lift them out one at a time and put them on
an extra galley above the working galley, standing them in sequence
along the lower rim with the nicks up. Put the first line into the
stick, take out words or insert new ones as directed in the proof, then
take the words in order from the galley, make any corrections called
for, re-space and justify to the end. If the lines are long, a brass
rule or composing rule of the right length should be used to measure off
the new lines, and these may be taken into the stick a line at a time
instead of a few words at a time.</p>

<p>Another method of over-running does not require the extra galley if
there is some spare room at the bottom of the matter on its own galley.
Insert the rule at the top of the line where the over-run commences and
move the matter down the galley a distance equal to the length of the
lines and an inch farther. Take the first line into the stick. Then turn
a half dozen or more of the following lines so that the nicks of the
type are toward the lower rim of the galley, keeping the ends of the
lines against the matter farther down. Put a piece of 4-em metal
furniture at the other end of the turned lines to prevent letters from
falling down. Correct the line in the stick and proceed by taking the
words in order from the turned lines. If more lines are to be over-run,
take them from their regular position in the galley and turn them nicks
down in the same way as the first lot.</p>

<p>The spacing of over-run lines should be done as carefully as for the
original setting. Sometimes lines too thinly or too widely spaced in the
original may be improved in the re-spacing. Unfortunately, much work of
this kind is done in a rush and the second justification is neglected.
Yet the difference in time taken to do

<span class="pagenum"><a href="images/p042.png" name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Page&nbsp;42]</a></span>

good spacing and that spent on careless work is often very little.</p>

<p>Hand compositors now do a great deal of correcting and page make-up on
type set by machines. This work is often in the nature of specialties,
yet the general rules of good spacing and justifying apply here also.
Usually greater speed is required, and this means more skill and
oftentimes the employment of some special facilities adapted for the
particular class of work in hand.</p>

<p>It is a rule that any lines of type pied during corrections and reset
must have a mark around them on the revise proof to call attention to
them for another reading to be sure that no new error has been made.</p>

<h2 class="sechead"><a name="section_17" id="section_17"></a>Importance of Uniform Spacing</h2>

<p>The beginner will realize after he has set his first few stickfuls that
the part of the operation which gives him the greatest trouble is not
finding the types for the words of his copy, but it is getting uniform
spaces between the words to justify the lines. To the uninitiated the
words of a well-set page appear to be separated with spaces of equal
thickness. This is far from the fact; it is only in rare instances that
several lines in a page have spaces that are exactly alike. A close
examination of a page will show a great variety of white spaces between
words, although the difference may not be readily recognized by the
ordinary reader.</p>

<p>In order to make the reading easy and legible the words should be spaced
enough to make them quickly distinguishable at a glance. In order to
make it comfortable and pleasing the words should be spaced uniformly
and the lines arranged orderly, with neither undue huddling together nor
unnecessary separation. Good typesetting means that the spacing must be
approximately even and that the average space must be carefully
proportioned to the style of the type face,

<span class="pagenum"><a href="images/p043.png" name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Page&nbsp;43]</a></span>

the distance between the lines, and the size and shape of the page.</p>

<p>Uniform spacing between the words in a line is always desirable. A thin
space on one side of a word and a wide space on the other is an
inexcusable fault. An exception is made of the space between sentences,
where the ending of one and the beginning of another occurs in the same
line. In this case it is customary to leave a wide space after the
period.</p>

<p>Lines should not be wide-spaced at one end and thin-spaced at the other.
Absolute evenness may not be easily secured, but an appearance of
uniformity may be given by observing some of the methods described
further on in these pages.</p>

<p>Good spacing means also that all the lines of a composition should be
spaced as nearly alike as is practicable. The extremes of a wide-spaced
line and a thin-spaced line in the same paragraph, or of a wide-spaced
paragraph and a thin-spaced paragraph of similar types on the same page,
should be avoided.</p>

<p>The last line of a paragraph should not be spaced wider than the average
spacing in the paragraph itself. Many compositors have a habit of
wide-spacing a line which happens to have a few words in it, with the
evident aim to make these few words fill the line as much as possible.
This often results in lines needlessly wide-spaced.</p>

<h2 class="sechead"><a name="section_18" id="section_18"></a>Rules for Spacing</h2>

<p>The standard space between words in ordinary roman lower-case type is
the 3-space. This thickness is commonly accepted as the average spacing
required for legibility in a printed page to be held in the hand. It
gives comfortable legibility in sizes of type from 8-point to 14-point.
Smaller sizes may be spaced with an average slightly wider, like the en
quad, while for large types to be read at close range the spacing may be
less than the 3-space average.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a href="images/p044.png" name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Page&nbsp;44]</a></span></p>

<p>Wide measures, as a rule, require relatively wide spacing. Narrow
measures are preferably thin-spaced, whether the lines are leaded or
solid.</p>

<p>An apparently equal spacing between all words in a line means that in
some cases there must be a slight variation in the width of the actual
spaces used. The size and shape of the letters at the ends of words will
often affect the amount of white space, especially in the larger faces
of type.</p>

<p>There are several combinations of word endings which call for spaces
thinner or thicker than the average in the line in order to make all the
spaces appear equal. These little variations can be made while changing
the spaces to justify the line. They need not, for the most part, take
any extra time, while the resulting evenness in the spacing of the page
will be noticeable. Good spacing without spending unnecessary time is
usually a matter of following a few simple rules.</p>

<p>When necessary to use thinner spaces to get a complete word or syllable
in the line, put these thin spaces after a comma, or<a id="tn2_3" name="tn2_3"></a>
between word endings like &mdash;&mdash;e&nbsp;w&mdash;&mdash;,
&mdash;&mdash;y&nbsp;a&mdash;&mdash;. Word endings like
&mdash;&mdash;y&nbsp;A&mdash;&mdash;, &mdash;&mdash;w&nbsp;v&mdash;&mdash;,
&mdash;&mdash;y&nbsp;u&mdash;&mdash; can be very thinly spaced if necessary.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if a little extra space is needed to fill the line,
increase the spaces between words ending with tall
letters,&mdash;&mdash;d&nbsp;l&mdash;&mdash;,
&mdash;&mdash;f&nbsp;b&mdash;&mdash;, etc.</p>

<p>Abbreviated words and initials with the period (Mrs. Rev. M.D. Ph.D.
etc.) are places where thin spaces are properly used.</p>

<p>A thin space is required before colons, semicolons, question marks, and
exclamation marks, when these are cast on thin bodies. These points
should be followed by an extra-wide space. That is, if the line is
spaced with a 3-space as the average, a semicolon should have a 5-space
before it and an en quad after. If the line is thin-spaced, the spaces
before and after the semicolon are reduced also. In some fonts of type
these

<span class="pagenum"><a href="images/p045.png" name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Page&nbsp;45]</a></span>

punctuation marks are cast on thick bodies which furnish a slight
shoulder on each side of the face of the mark. In such cases the extra
spaces may not be required in ordinary composition.</p>

<p>When a question mark or an exclamation mark finishes a sentence, it
should be followed by a space equal to that used after periods in other
parts of the same matter.</p>

<p>The em dash usually should have a little space on each side of it,
especially if the line is spaced with 3-spaces or wider. If the line is
thin-spaced, the dash also may be set close to the adjoining words.
Whenever possible avoid putting the dash at the end of the line in
paragraphs; try to keep it within the line.</p>

<p>A short line, consisting of a word or syllable of two or three letters
only, should be avoided at the end of a paragraph, especially in a
measure of ordinary width. In a very narrow measure it may not be
avoided. Where the other lines of the page are fairly well filled this
short line will make an objectionable break in the matter. If it cannot
be taken back to the preceding line, a little wider spacing of these
lines will allow an additional word or syllable to be brought over to
lengthen the objectionable short line.</p>

<p>It is desirable to end a paragraph with an em quad, if this is
practicable, rather than fill the last line flush. Do not leave an
ordinary space after the period.</p>

<p>When justifying the last line of a paragraph or a headline in which
quads are used, keep the justifying spaces next to the types. Do not put
small pieces at the end of a quad line or scatter them between the large
quads. They will be easier to distribute if placed after the period.</p>

<p>Hyphenated words in a widely spaced line should have a hair space on
each side of a thin hyphen; but this may not be necessary if the hyphen
is cast on a thick body, as it is in some fonts.</p>

<p>The dollar sign $ is set close to the whole numbers

<span class="pagenum"><a href="images/p046.png" name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Page&nbsp;46]</a></span>

in printing amounts of money: $25. When specifying fractions of a dollar
(in tabular columns only) put a space between the sign and the decimal:
$&nbsp;.25. The symbols for English money are also placed close to the
figures, thus &pound;10&nbsp;5s&nbsp;2d.</p>

<p>When justifying lines some compositors commence respacing at one end of
the line and increase the spaces in order till the line is full,
regardless of the length of the words or the word endings, repeating
this line after line. The result is that one side of the matter is
spaced wider than the other&mdash;a most inexcusable fault. If a few spaces
wider than the average must be used in the line, put these between long
words or words with tall letters; and <i>vice versa</i>, if thin spaces are
necessary, put them between short words or words with small letters. Do
not wide-space short words and leave long words in the same line with
thin spaces. Do not, however, if it can be avoided, allow wide spaces to
be repeated nearly under each other, to produce noticeable straggling
white spaces or &ldquo;rivers&rdquo; up and down the page. Spacing of this sort is
particularly objectionable for good printing.</p>

<p>An old-time rule required an em quad after a period before beginning
another sentence in the line. This is the practice in many places now,
but there is an objection to the unnecessary large white spot which it
makes in the ordinary page of reading matter. As a distinction between
sentences it seems too conspicuous except in matter that is wide-leaded
and wide-spaced. The modern practice in good work is to reduce this
space to the double 3-space or the en quad, or even to the 3-space in
small pages.</p>

<p>Another unnecessarily large space in narrow measure of solid or
single-leaded lines is an em quad after the period or Roman numeral in
numbered paragraphs. Where the period is used an en quad following it is
sufficient.</p>

<p>In good composition quotation marks should not be

<span class="pagenum"><a href="images/p047.png" name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Page&nbsp;47]</a></span>

crowded close against the words which they enclose, unless the lines are
close-spaced. Commas and apostrophes cast on very thin types usually
need a little space between the quote-marks they form and the words they
enclose, especially if they are next to tall letters. A large capital A
or a sloping italic capital at the beginning<a id="tn2_4" name="tn2_4"></a>
may not need the separating
space after the inverted commas, and a period or a comma between the
last word and the final quote-mark will furnish the needed separation.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 1em; letter-spacing: 0.1em;">&ldquo;Q
<span style="letter-spacing: 0em; margin-left: -0.35em;">uote-marks properly spaced.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p style="text-indent: 1em; letter-spacing: -0.1em;">&ldquo;T
<span style="letter-spacing: 0em; margin-left: -0.15em;">hese are not well spaced.</span>
<span style="letter-spacing: 0.1em;">&rdquo;</span></p>

<p style="text-indent: 1em; letter-spacing: 0.1em;">&ldquo;&lsquo;
<span style="letter-spacing: 0em; margin-left: -0.35em;">Quotes&rsquo; within &lsquo;quotes&rsquo; are like this.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>In open-spaced matter there should be a thin space between an
exclamation or question mark and the final quote-mark, thus:</p>

<p style="letter-spacing: 0.1em;">&ldquo;
<span style="letter-spacing: 0em; margin-left: -0.35em;">Do you wish to become a good compositor</span>
<span style="letter-spacing: 0.15em; margin-left: -0.15em;">?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>Letter-spacing, or inter-spacing, is frequently employed in headings and
in job and display composition. It is rarely a good practice in ordinary
lower-case composition in paragraph form. In very narrow measures, where
word length or word divisions do not come right to make the lines the
desired length, the letter-spacing of a few words is sometimes resorted
to in order to extend the words. This should be done with care to avoid
making such words conspicuous in the general appearance of the page. It
is better to letter-space the whole line a little rather than to put
excess spacing in one unimportant word.</p>

<p>Black-letter, Old English, Priory Text, Cloister Black, and similar
varieties should not be wide-spaced, nor should they ever be
letter-spaced. The beauty of such letters, which are now used for their
decorative rather than utilitarian qualities, depends upon the
consistent, well-balanced relation between the white and black spaces of
the composition. The compactness of the letter shapes makes words that
are compact and unified. As there are relatively close spaces

<span class="pagenum"><a href="images/p048.png" name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Page&nbsp;48]</a></span>

between the strokes of the letters, so there should be thin spaces
between the words of the lines and between the lines. Wide spaces
between words do not necessarily make them more legible. A comparison of
the two groups of lines following will show one as easy to read as the
other, while the close-spaced example is less confusing in its detail.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img class="noborder w400 pad1top" src="images/f048.png" width="400" height="190" alt="Black Letter Example: These Two Lines Are Spaced About Right, These Two Lines Are Wide Spaced" />
</div>

<h2 class="sechead"><a name="section_19" id="section_19"></a>Spacing of Italic</h2>

<p>A paragraph of italic type is more difficult to space evenly than the
same lines in roman letters. Usually the average spacing may be about
the same as the companion face of roman; but more frequently than in
roman types the spaces in a line may need to be of unequal thickness in
order to give a uniform appearance to the spacing. Overhanging letters
are frequent and when these come at the beginning or end of words they
require a little more space than is used for words ending or beginning
with small letters. Word pairs with letters like
&mdash;&mdash;<i>f&nbsp;p</i>&mdash;&mdash; and
&mdash;&mdash;<i>l&nbsp;h</i>&mdash;&mdash; will in most cases need wider
spaces than are used between pairs like
&mdash;&mdash;<i>e&nbsp;w</i>&mdash;&mdash; and
&mdash;&mdash;<i>s&nbsp;A</i>&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>Some italic capitals have extra shoulder-space on the left of the face,
like <i>T</i>, <i>W</i>, <i>V</i>, which should be allowed for by thin spacing when
they follow small lower-case letters. This extra shoulder is made on
letters of this kind to protect the overhanging kern of an adjoining
letter when words are set in capitals.</p>

<p>Where an italic <i>f</i>, <i>j</i>, or other kerned letter comes at the beginning
or end of a line a thin space should be

<span class="pagenum"><a href="images/p049.png" name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Page&nbsp;49]</a></span>

placed outside of it to keep it from projecting beyond the side of the
page, where it is easily broken off. This is important if the matter is
to be moulded for electrotyping.</p>

<p>On account of the frequency of overhanging letters italic types require
very careful handling during composition, correcting, and locking up. If
the kerns over-ride an adjoining type or are subjected to a slight blow
of any kind they are easily broken off.</p>

<h2 class="sechead"><a name="section_20" id="section_20"></a>Spacing Capital Letters</h2>

<p>Words in capitals need wider spacing than those in lower-case of the
same size. Capitals occupy more space on the type body than small
letters and consequently they need a little more openness between the
words and between the lines to give them a proportionate relief of white
space for legibility.</p>

<p>Roman capitals of the standard faces are often sufficiently spaced with
the en quad if the words are short. Long words in a headline may need
double 3-spaces, while lines of round open capitals in an open area may
need the em quad.</p>

<p>A simple rule to follow is to space wide letters with wide spaces, and
thin or condensed letters with narrow spaces. This may be put another
way by saying that the spacing should approximate the average width of
the letters used, taking an entire alphabet as the basis. Thus, if the
alphabet of capitals measures 18&nbsp;ems, the average width of the letters
would be <span class="above">18</span>&#8260;<span class="below">26</span>ths, or approximately
<span class="above">2</span>&#8260;<span class="below">3</span>
of the em.</p>

<p>Like all rules, this is subject to modifications in special cases. The
shapes of the letters which end and begin the words may make it
desirable to increase or decrease the spaces in some places. Word
endings like &mdash;&mdash;L&nbsp;T&mdash;&mdash; and
&mdash;&mdash;Y&nbsp;A&mdash;&mdash; should have a little thinner space
than is used between those ending and beginning with full-bodied upright
letters like &mdash;&mdash;M&nbsp;R&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img class="noborder w500" src="images/f049.png" width="500" height="35" alt="Examples: VERY AGED and BOTTOM RIM" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a href="images/p050.png" name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Page&nbsp;50]</a></span></p>

<p>In small types the inequalities in white space around letters of
different shapes may not be readily seen, but in large sizes these
differences increase in noticeable degree. A careful compositor will
select his spaces to equalize these little differences and thus avoid
the numerous inconsistent defects sure to result from mere mechanical
justification of the lines.</p>

<p>Combinations of capitals like the following example show distinctly
uneven white spaces between the letters of the word. These should be
equalized wherever possible by the use of thin leads or cards between
the close-fitted letters.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img class="noborder w400" src="images/f050a.png" width="400" height="80" alt="Example: VAINLY ATTEMPTED" />
</div>

<p>This differential spacing will also be desirable in a line having
abbreviations or initials. The following example spaced with en quads in
every place shows an excess of white between the initials because of the
presence of the periods.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img class="noborder w520 pad05top" src="images/f050b.png" width="520" height="60" alt="Example (before and after spacing): HON. JOHN L. SMITH  MARK HARRIS, D. D. S." />
</div>

<p>A thinner space between the initials gives uniform spacing through the
line.</p>

<p>Large initials used in groups, as in college degrees and military
titles, are often set close together with simply the period for
separation. This style is preferred in any close-spaced matter; though
for more open matter a thin space may be used after the periods.</p>

<p>Two or more lines of capitals of the same size should be spaced as
nearly alike as possible. The disproportionate spacing of the following
three lines is sometimes seen, but is not pleasing:</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a href="images/p051.png" name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Page&nbsp;51]</a></span></p>

<p>Lines of small capitals of normal size are often sufficiently spaced
with the 3-space and slightly wider when in paragraph form. When used in
headings and open-leaded matter en-quad spacing is required.</p>

</div>

<h2 class="sechead"><a name="section_21" id="section_21"></a>Wide Spacing</h2>

<p>Letters and words huddled together so that they are not readily
recognized at a glance do not make easy reading. On the other hand, very
wide spacing does not necessarily result in a proportionate increase of
legibility; it may even produce results as confusing as very thin
spacing.</p>

</div>

<p>A general rule affecting wide spacing is that the average distance
between the words in the line should be less than the distance between
the lines themselves. Notice in the above example how the words group
themselves up and down the page rather than in order along the line for
the eye to follow. Note also

<span class="pagenum"><a href="images/p052.png" name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Page&nbsp;52]</a></span>

how wide spaces between the words form distinct, irregular streaks up
and down the page to lead the eye away from its course along a single
line at a time.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img class="noborder pad13 w470" src="images/f052.png" width="470" height="80" alt="Example: WIDE SPACING FOR EASY READING HAS LITTLE ADVANTAGE UNLESS THE LINES ARE LEADED OUT" />
</div>

<p>Wide spacing for easy reading has little advantage unless the lines are
leaded out in equal proportion.</p>

<p>Double-leaded lines are well spaced with an average of an en quad. When
this is used the limit of space would be the double 3-space, while the
thin space would be the single 3-space.</p>

<p>An average spacing wider than the en quad is rarely ever necessary in
roman lower-case matter even if the lines are separated with more than
the double leads. The only excuse for the wider spacing is the necessity
for making words and syllables fill the line.</p>

<p>In some kinds of composition wide spacing and wide leading are
desirable. Wide measures and ample white space up and down the page
naturally call for open spacing of type lines. Large advertisements,
wall cards, placards, and other forms intended to be read at a distance
farther away than the book or magazine in the hand, are properly
wide-spaced and wide-leaded. Extremes in openness, however, are not safe
to follow. A study of the work of the leading designers in typography
will show a compact grouping of both words and lines which gives unity
and orderliness with ample readability. In contrast with this the
disconnected, patchy, scattered effects shown in commonplace type
composition will prove that habitual wide-spacing is often unnecessary.</p>

<h2 class="sechead"><a name="section_22" id="section_22"></a>Paragraph and Other Indentions</h2>

<p>There are several styles of indention employed in type composition.
These are known as (1) regular paragraph,

<span class="pagenum"><a href="images/p053.png" name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Page&nbsp;53]</a></span>

(2) hanging indention, (3) half-diamond indention or inverted pyramid
indention, with its variation of lozenge-shape formation, (4) squared
indention, and (5) diagonal indention.</p>

<p class="hanging s8">Hanging indention is where the first line of a paragraph begins flush
and the second and succeeding lines are indented, as in this paragraph.
It is a common form in catalogs, tabular work, and also in poetry.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="preceding" name="preceding"></a>
<img class="noborder w500" src="images/f053a.png" width="500" height="120" alt="Example: Half-diamond indention is when successive lines are indented at both ends, each one being shorter than the preceding line, as shown in this paragraph.

<p class="blockquot2">It is often advisable to indent lines at both ends, to make several
short lines instead of one or two long lines. In cases of this kind
the first line is not indented more than the others, as shown in
this paragraph. Squared indention is used for short paragraphs in
advertising matter, bits of minor display, and miscellaneous
composition.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img class="noborder w470 pad06top" src="images/f053t.png" width="470" height="70" alt="Example: Diagonal indention is when the lines of type are so arranged that they follow after each other diagonally in this style." />
</div>

<p>Another manner of indenting lines, somewhat rare in this country but
common in Europe, is termed French motto indention. This is usually made
with small types, the paragraph being set in squared-up fashion at the
right side of the page, within the measure.</p>

<p>An indention should be enough to indicate the paragraph clearly, yet not
be so wide as to make it a conspicuous

<span class="pagenum"><a href="images/p054.png" name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Page&nbsp;54]</a></span>

white spot on the page. Its purpose is to show the reader a change of
subject or a minor subdivision of the matter. The amount of indention
necessary to attain this will vary in different forms of composition,
and therefore only general rules can be given.</p>

<p>The usual indention of paragraphs in plain reading matter is an em quad
at the beginning of the first line. If the lines are more than average
length the indention may be increased to one and a half ems, two ems, or
more. Indentions of over two ems, however, are seldom allowable in
ordinary reading matter like books and periodicals.</p>

<p>Wide indentions should not be made in narrow measures; nor should
indistinct, insignificant indentions be made in broad measures.</p>

<p>Paragraphs set in 10-point or 12-point type in measures from 15 to 20&nbsp;picas
wide are sufficiently indented by the em quad, while 6-point type
in the same measure should be indented with a two-em quad.</p>

<p>Wide-leaded, open matter will call for a little more paragraph
indention, as a rule, than is given to thin-spaced solid-line
paragraphs. In pamphlets, circulars, advertisements, and job work, where
wide leading and broken lines of a miscellaneous character are frequent,
paragraph indentions may be wider than in book pages. On the other hand,
in composition of this kind where other means of showing the
commencement of a subject are used, indentions are omitted and the
paragraphs begun flush at the margin.</p>

<p>The indention of paragraphs should be uniform throughout any single book
or job. It is rare that more than two different widths of indention are
needed to give a clear idea of the classification of any group of
subjects. A variety of indentions on the same page is confusing and
often spoils the orderly arrangement of the matter which the copy writer
sought to obtain. Even where there are several sizes of type on the
page,

<span class="pagenum"><a href="images/p055.png" name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Page&nbsp;55]</a></span>

if the paragraphs are the same width, the indentions should be alike.</p>

<p>A common defect that is made conspicuous when wide indentions are made
in paragraphs following each other is the occurrence of a single short
word or syllable in the last line of a paragraph, as shown in this
example:</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img class="noborder w470 pad05top" src="images/f055.png" width="470" height="90" alt="Example: Every printer's apprentice should carefully read and study these simple rules for the indention and spacing of type. He should study all the books of this series." />
</div>

<p>This constitutes a &ldquo;bad break&rdquo; and should be avoided either by
thin-spacing the last two or three lines of the paragraph to take the
short word back and save the line, or by over-running the lines with
wider spaces to bring more words to the last line. The choice of these
expedients will depend upon the openness or closeness of the
composition, in many cases upon the make-up of the page. If a line can
be saved, take the solitary word back; if the line is needed, space out
the preceding lines, provided it may be done without making bad spacing.</p>

<h2 class="sechead"><a name="section_23" id="section_23"></a>Setting Poetry</h2>

<p>The indention of lines of poetry is sometimes a puzzling matter for the
inexperienced compositor, unless he is given printed copy or carefully
prepared manuscript in which the line indentions are clearly indicated.
There are few rules which govern the subject and these few are sometimes
ignored in practice.</p>

<p>If the composing stick will accommodate each line of verse in a line of
type the composition will be much simplified. The first consideration
will be to indent the lines so that the general body of the poem is
approximately near the middle of the page or column. When the lines vary
in length a great deal some calculation is needed to get the right
indention without going over them the second time. The longest line
should be set

<span class="pagenum"><a href="images/p056.png" name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Page&nbsp;56]</a></span>

first and the indention of the others made to accord with this. In this
case some lines will be set a little at the left of the page.</p>

<p>Indention of poetry is made with even em quads of the type used. The
variations in indention are also graduated by ems; usually one em, but
sometimes two, three, or more, according to the relative length of
lines. The odd spaces needed for justifying are put after the last word
in the line.</p>

<p>As a rule, lines which rhyme with each other are indented alike.</p>

<div class="poem s8"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Pick and click<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Goes the type in the stick,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">As the printer stands at his case;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His eyes glance quick and his fingers pick<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The type at a rapid pace.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>One of the commonest forms of verse is that in which the alternating
lines or the second and fourth lines rhyme. In this case the second line
of each pair is indented one em beyond the first. If the lines are long
and the type small the indention may be two ems.</p>

<p class="poemtitle1 pad1top nobot s9">(Rhyme of first and third, second and fourth lines.)</p>

<div class="poem s8"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When Freedom from her mountain height<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Unfurled her standard to the air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She tore the azure robe of night<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And set the stars of glory there.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="poemtitle1 pad2top nobot s9">(Rhyme of second and fourth lines.)</p>

<div class="poem s8"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There is no wrath in the stars,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">They do not rage in the sky;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I look from the Evil Wood<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And find myself wondering why.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In many cases, however, rhymes like those above are set without varying
the indention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a href="images/p057.png" name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Page&nbsp;57]</a></span></p>

<p>When the rhyme follows at certain intervals, the rhyming lines are
indented alike:</p>

<div class="poem s8"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">My country, &rsquo;tis of thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweet land of liberty,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Of thee I sing;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Land where my fathers died,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Land of the Pilgrims&rsquo; pride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From ev&rsquo;ry mountain side<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Let freedom ring.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In blank verse the indention of lines is uniform, the only consideration
being to indent the lines so that the general group will be somewhere
near the middle of the page.</p>

<div class="poem s8"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Who draws a line and satisfies his soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Making it crooked where it should be straight?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An idiot with an oyster shell may draw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His lines along the sand, all wavering,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fixing no point, or pathway to a point.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An idiot once removed may choose his line,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">As willingly as any singing bird<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sets him to sing his morning roundelay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because he likes to sing and likes the song.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A uniform indention is also given to poems in which the rhyme is in two
adjoining lines.</p>

<div class="poem s8"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He spoke of the grass and flowers and trees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the singing birds and the humming bees;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then talked of the haying, and wondered whether<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cloud in the West would bring foul weather.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>When a line is too long to come into the page width the surplus words
are turned over to the next line; to avoid confusion this turn-over is
indented differently from the beginning of a regular line commencing
with a capital.</p>

<div class="poem s8"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Gallop and sing, gallop and sing!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the open road before,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And my good horse laying his hoofs to<br /></span>

<p>If the compositor is given any discretion in setting poetry, care should
be taken to regulate the length of line and the indentions so that lines
will not turn over into extra lines unnecessarily; yet, when the measure
is narrow it is better to turn over an occasional long line rather than
to place the whole poem out of the center.</p>

<h2 class="sechead"><a name="section_24" id="section_24"></a>Headings</h2>

<p>The usual heading, termed a center head, is set in the middle of the
line. It may be in capitals of the text or in a larger size. If capitals
and lower-case are used the size should be several sizes larger, or the
face should be bolder. In any case a main heading should be a little
more prominent than a line of the text.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img class="noborder w400" src="images/f058a.png" width="400" height="60" alt="Example: TYPESETTING" />
</div>

<p><a id="tn2_5" name="tn2_5"></a>A sub-heading is a secondary heading and may be in the center of the
measure or a side heading at the beginning of the line. In the latter
place it may be in a line by itself, set flush, in italic, in caps. and
small caps., or in small bold face; or it may be set in the first line
of the paragraph, with the regular indention.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img class="noborder w400" src="images/f058b.png" width="400" height="45" alt="Example: A PRIMER OF INFORMATION" />
</div>

<p>A cut-in head is set in a panel, with or without rule, after the second
or third line of the first paragraph.</p>

<p>A running head is at the top of each page of a book or other work of a
number of pages. In books and pamphlets the page number is usually at
the outside end of the running-head line.</p>

<p>Box headings are enclosed in rules at the top of columns in tabular
matter.</p>

<p>In modern practice no punctuation is placed at the end of headings,
except the question and quotation marks when these are required. In a
heading of two

<span class="pagenum"><a href="images/p059.png" name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Page&nbsp;59]</a></span>

or more lines where a comma or semicolon comes naturally at the end of
the first or second line, its omission may change or confuse the sense
of the phrase. In such cases it should be used, even if the period is
left off the end of the heading.</p>

<p><a id="tn2_45" name="tn2_45"></a>For additional comment on headings and
punctuation see other titles of this series: <a href="#bib_20">Book Composition

<h2 class="sechead"><a name="section_25" id="section_25"></a>Initial Letters</h2>

<p>An initial at the beginning of a chapter or other text requires nicety
of spacing and justification. In modern practice the use of initials is
often overdone, being used in many cases where they might better be
omitted. Before the invention of typography, and since, the initial
letter has been considered the feature of a page that could be used for
decorative purposes. Early manuscripts show many elaborate, beautifully
colored initials done by artists and illuminators. It was the custom of
early printers to leave blank spaces in their printed pages for initials
to be drawn in later. In some cases a small letter was printed in the
middle of a large space as a guide to the artist. These small letters
would be covered by the larger letter, but sometimes they were left as
printed and the decoration drawn around them to fill the space. Later
the ornamental initials were cut on wood or cast in metal and printed
with the text.</p>

<p>As an initial is usually a prominent spot on a page its selection should
be a matter of care. A plain letter of a style of face similar to the
text is always a safe choice; an old-style letter for a text set in
oldstyle roman, or a modern-cut Bodoni for Bodoni text. If the text is
in italic an italic initial is more suitable than an upright letter.
Extremely bold initials are not suitable for small types or light-faced
text matter.</p>

<p>The size of an initial should be considered in relation

<span class="pagenum"><a href="images/p060.png" name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Page&nbsp;60]</a></span>

to the size of the page and the size of the type used. In small pages of
type of 10-point or smaller, a two-line letter will often be large
enough; while a large page will require a large initial. If the initial
is an ornamental letter it should be of a similar style of ornament to a
head-piece or other decoration that may be on the page. Two different
styles of initials or other decorative features of a page should be
avoided.</p>

<p>In setting an initial into the beginning of a paragraph the letter is
placed in the stick and the first line of text set after it. The letters
of the first word are set in capitals usually, unless the first word is
very long and the line of capitals is too prominent, when small capitals
may be used. If the first word contains two or three letters only the
next word is also set in capitals. The top of the initial should be even
with the top of the first line of the text. If the initial has more
shoulder than the body type, which is usually the case, a lead or more
may be needed at the top of the first line. This should be properly
lined up in the stick.</p>

<p>The spacing between the initial and the text depends upon the particular
letter of the alphabet used, if a plain letter, or upon the decoration
around the initial. The other letters of the first word are kept close
to the initial, but the beginning of the second and succeeding lines are
separated from it a little. In this way the initial has a closer
relation to the word to which it belongs. The space at the right of the
initial, between it and the text, should be apparently equal to that
below it. It should not be extra wide in either place, or it will give
the initial a detached appearance. To avoid this extra wide space it may
be necessary to trim off some of the shoulder from the type, especially
below the face. The proper size for an initial-letter should be equal to
the number of text lines which it covers. This is not always practicable
when miscellaneous types are selected from other fonts. If they are to
be put back in their fonts after use as initials they may not

<span class="pagenum"><a href="images/p061.png" name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Page&nbsp;61]</a></span>

be trimmed to odd sizes of body; nor should they ever be trimmed so
without express permission of the foreman. For the usual work it is
possible to use an initial that is a multiple of the text size with or
without leads. An 18-point letter may be used for two-line initial in an
8-point text with 2-point leads; or a 24-point letter in leaded 10-point
text.</p>

<p>The width of initials is very likely to make text lines after them of
odd length rather than even picas or nonpareils. If the text is solid,
this odd length of line is easily justified to the measure; but in case
leads are used and even-pica leads do not fit it may be necessary to cut
a few special odd-length leads to fit the lines. First, however, after
the top line has been justified, put a few leads of even picas in the
stick and try a short lead or two up and down beside the initial to fill
in to the even-pica leads. If these extra vertical leads do not leave
too much space around the initial they will do to take up the odd
measure. Sometimes a thin space of a size two points larger than the
text may be used.</p>

<h2 class="sechead"><a name="section_26" id="section_26"></a>Making Up Pages</h2>

<p>Make-up is the term describing the various operations of dividing
composed matter into pages of uniform length, adding the headings, page
numbers (folios), inserting small engravings, and otherwise preparing
the pages for locking up in a chase for the press or the electrotype
foundry.</p>

<p>Newspaper pages and other large page forms of two or more columns are
customarily made up on the stone or a similar flat surface in a special
chase, with side-sticks and lock-up fitted for the form.</p>

<p>Pages for books, catalogs, and other small and medium sizes are made up
on a broad galley placed on the inclined top of the compositor&rsquo;s stand
or cabinet. The compositor who does this work regularly has the working
top of his stand fitted with material and conveniences

<span class="pagenum"><a href="images/p062.png" name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Page&nbsp;62]</a></span>

which should help him to do the work without waste of time. There are
several styles of make-up cabinets furnished by dealers in printers&rsquo;
goods. These are designed with the object of keeping near the workman a
supply of leads, rules, furniture, and other articles frequently used,
so that he may save steps and minutes in doing his work.</p>

<p>It is important that the make-up galley should set firmly and that the
bottom should not sag. If it is liable to move at a slight touch, or the
bottom is uneven, the type lines will fall down easily, thereby adding
to the care and time needed for the work.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img class="noborder w400" src="images/f062.jpg" width="400" height="228" alt="The Make-up Galley" />
<p class="caption smcap">Fig.&nbsp;&nbsp;19</p>
</div>

<p>The galley is laid with its closed end or head at the right hand. A
strip should be nailed on the shelf at the right to act as a stop to
hold the galley in place while working on it, especially to prevent it
from moving when the lines are pushed up to test the length of the page.</p>

<p>The make-up compositor works with his right side inclined toward the
stand, as when making corrections on the galley. The galley should not
be so high as to be uncomfortable for the right arm, which must be held
over it while working on the pages.</p>

<p>The common practice in making up is to handle the pages sideways, with
the top toward the right hand, so that the sequence of lines follows to
the left down the galley. In this way the beginning of each line rests
against the lower galley rim, and by the use of leads or

<span class="pagenum"><a href="images/p063.png" name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Page&nbsp;63]</a></span>

rules one or any number of lines can be taken out or moved back and
forth on the galley with safety. Some job compositors handle small forms
with the top line along the lower rim of the galley. This method may
suffice with a few lines of large type, but it is not recommended. It is
not practicable for pages of many lines or for lines without leads.</p>

<p>The galley matter should be corrected and revised before making up
begins. This is important in a work of a number of pages, as any
considerable changes after the pages are tied up usually require extra
labor. If the revise proofs show only a few corrections, these may be
made in advance, a galley or more at a time, by the make-up hand.</p>

<p>The justification of the lines requires particular attention, and all
faulty lines should be re-justified. If there are many lines requiring
extra time for rectifying the fact should be reported to the foreman or
the compositor at fault. Badly justified lines should not be passed over
and allowed to go to the imposing stone, in the expectation that they
may be rectified when the locking up is done. All justifying should be
done and all corrections made as far as possible while the matter is on
the galley.</p>

<p>When there is enough composition for a number of pages a gage should be
made to measure the exact length of the pages. For a few pages, like a
circular or a program, an ordinary pica measure may be used, the length
being defined as a given number of picas or lines. If there are to be a
number of pages, a page gage should be made from a strip of reglet or
brass rule. The gage should include the length of a full page, over all,
from the top of the running head down to the foot slug. It may be marked
on its upper edge to show the depth of the running head and any other
uniform division to be repeated on several pages.</p>

<p>For book pages set in one size of type the length should be determined
by even lines of the type used

<span class="pagenum"><a href="images/p064.png" name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Page&nbsp;64]</a></span>

and the running head. No extra leads should be put here and there
between the lines or paragraphs of a regular text page; these are used
only in broken pages, above and below headings, engravings, or in
separating extracts, foot notes, etc. If the pages contain several sizes
of type the gage should indicate the exact length of the printed face,
as different sizes of type have different amounts of shoulder below the
face. For example, a page set in 12-point type would have a pica slug
below the last line; if the next page contained a foot note set in
8-point, with the pica slug below, and both pages were exactly the same
length, the face of the 8-point note would be a point below the face of
the 12-point line on the first page. In this case a 1-point lead should
be taken from above the 8-point note and put between the note and the
foot slug.</p>

<p>For a book, periodical, or other work that is to be made up frequently
from time to time there should be a durable steel or brass page gage,
carefully marked for depth of running head, chapter sinkage, drop folio,
or any other feature to be kept in uniform position.</p>

<p>Galley matter to be made up into pages of a uniform number of lines
should be first marked off with slips of card or slugs at the places
where the matter breaks into pages. This is done with the page gage,
making allowance for running heads and other features not yet in the
matter. If the division comes badly at some places a change of a line
more or less at some preceding page and a shifting of the dividing place
will eliminate the awkward break. It may happen in the first casting off
that a sub-head comes at the bottom of a page, or the last short line of
a paragraph comes at the top of a page, or the pages divide in the
middle of a short table. These objectionable divisions may usually be
overcome by a change in the starting at the first page, taking a line or
two from the second page, and so on to the third and succeeding pages;
or, on the other hand, adding a line or two to the succeeding page.
Sometimes

<span class="pagenum"><a href="images/p065.png" name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Page&nbsp;65]</a></span>

an extra line may be made by over-running two or three lines at the end
of a paragraph; or, if a line less is desirable, a short line at the end
of a paragraph may be saved by a little thinner spacing of a few
preceding lines.</p>

<p>A few moments spent in casting off the matter on two or three galleys
ahead of the actual making up will save a great deal of time later in
case a bad division makes necessary a little change in pages already
completed.</p>

<p>Rules regarding the make-up of book pages must be general for the most
part, as many things depend upon the character of the work and the
conditions under which it is done. In certain kinds of fine work there
are some careful details which can be overlooked in ordinary work that
must be done hurriedly and economically. Yet many desirable details of
good workmanship may be followed without extra expenditure of time or
material if the compositor and make-up hand understand how to do them
properly in the first place. A great part of the time and expense
devoted to preparing composed type for printing is due to the necessity
for going over the pages to correct important matters which could as
well have been done right in the first place if it were not for
carelessness or lack of knowledge.</p>

<p>The desirable division in a chapter or other composition of plain matter
is in the middle of a paragraph of four or preferably more than four
lines. There should be at least two lines of a paragraph together on a
page. There will thus be a full line at the bottom of one page and
another full line at the top of the next.</p>

<p>There are many cases, of course, where the natural division of pages
will come between paragraphs. An old-time rule tried to avoid this
because of the liability of losing the connection in reading from page
to page; but with pages plainly numbered and with consistent running
heads this rule has little value. The objection

<span class="pagenum"><a href="images/p066.png" name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Page&nbsp;66]</a></span>

to ending a page with the end of a paragraph may often be caused by the
presence of a very short line which gives a broken outline to an
otherwise symmetrical page.</p>

<p>The last line of a paragraph should not be put at the top of a page or a
column. This rule may be modified in ordinary work if the last line is
full length and its presence at the top of the page will avoid some
other objectionable feature.</p>

<p>The first line of a paragraph should not be left at the bottom of a
page, especially if there is a short line ending the paragraph
immediately above.</p>

<p>If there is no other way of following the two preceding rules, make two
facing pages a line shorter than the regular length by carrying the
lines backward or forward.</p>

<p>A short word divided by a hyphen at the end of a line should not be
divided between two pages. A little respacing of the bottom line of one
page and the top line of the next will usually overcome a division of
this sort.</p>

<p>In book work, the first page of the preface, introduction, table of
contents, and of each chapter should be sunk uniformly about one-sixth
of the distance down from the top of a full-length page. This space may
be varied in different books according to choice, but the sinkage should
be the same throughout any one book. These pages are always on the first
side of a leaf. If they make only one page each, the back of the leaf is
left blank.</p>

<p>The style of the running head is usually specified in instructions for
the work. The wording may be either (a) the title of the book on all
full pages, (b) the title of the book on the left-hand pages and the
chapter subject on the right-hand pages, (c) the title of a new subject
which begins, with or without a sub-head, in the text below. The latter
style is desirable in a book of many pages because the running heads,
carefully

<span class="pagenum"><a href="images/p067.png" name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Page&nbsp;67]</a></span>

phrased, serve as a running index of the contents of a book. First pages
of chapters with sunken heads do not have running heads.</p>

<p>The page number or folio is in the end of the running head line, the odd
numbers at the right and the even numbers at the left. The folio of the
first page of a chapter (which has no running head) is put at the bottom
of the page in the center, where it is termed a drop folio. This drop
folio should not be included in the regular length of the page, but put
in the lower margin a lead or two below the text, and set in figures of
a type smaller than the text of the page.</p>

<p>The space between the running head and the text matter should be equal
to a full line of quads. This is an average for plain book pages which
may be varied according to the leading of the page. The running head
should not appear disconnected from the page itself, nor on the other
hand should it be crowded on the top line of the text, especially if
there are likely to be wide gaps between paragraphs or around sub-heads.</p>

<p>A headline or sub-head and one line of text should not be left at the
bottom of a page. If it is not possible to get three lines of the
paragraph at the bottom of the page, let the page go short and call
attention to the irregularity.</p>

<p>A sub-head immediately under the running head is a combination to be
avoided if possible, especially if the same kind of type is used for
both, as is often the case.</p>

<p>Two or three lone lines should not be left for the last page of a
chapter. Try to allow enough for a quarter of a page or more.</p>

<h2 class="sechead"><a name="section_27" id="section_27"></a>Washing Type</h2>

<p>Clean printing can not be done from dirty type. For this reason, as well
as for greater ease and cleanliness in handling, it is important that
type (which has to be used over and over again) should be washed as
clean as possible after use. Ink should not be allowed

<span class="pagenum"><a href="images/p068.png" name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Page&nbsp;68]</a></span>

to dry hard on a form, as it will if left over night or over an idle
day. The type face should be cleaned after taking proofs. It should show
a clean face while corrections are being made, and also when it goes to
press or to the moulding room.</p>

<p>Type should not be distributed back into the case until it is well
cleaned after use.</p>

<p>Benzine is now very generally used to wash ink from type, electrotypes,
and other printing plates. When it can be obtained in good quality it is
a convenient washing fluid for printers&rsquo; use. It loosens up dry ink
quickly, evaporates in a few moments, and leaves the surface dry.</p>

<p>Benzine and other type washes are often used with a brush, but this is
not a good practice. The brush cleans the ink off the face of the type,
but does not carry off the ink, which is left to dry again down in the
hollow parts of the form and around the shoulder of the types where the
fluid has washed it. A brush soon becomes foul after repeated use; it
cannot be easily cleaned; it is usually retained in this condition and
while it rubs off the face it leaves greater foulness than it can take
away.</p>

<p>A soft rag rolled into a pad with a little benzine poured on its surface
will loosen the ink and take it off the type clean. When the pad gets
inky turn another part of the rag out to give a clean wiping surface.
When the rag gets dirty enough to soil the hands throw it in the waste
can and get a clean one.</p>

<p>Quite often, after the ink has been wiped off with a rag, a fairly
stiff, fine brush is needed to clean out dried ink and dirt that has
accumulated in small places like the counters of the letters and the
screens of halftone plates.</p>

<p>Gasoline is a tolerable substitute for benzine when the latter cannot be
obtained. It is not so satisfactory, however, because of the greasiness
which it leaves on the surface after evaporation. If the form is to be

<span class="pagenum"><a href="images/p069.png" name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Page&nbsp;69]</a></span>

re-inked immediately after cleaning this greasiness must be removed in
order to ink up again for a sharp, clear impression.</p>

<p>Kerosene may be used for washing off ink, but it also leaves a
disagreeable greasy surface, even more than gasoline does. For this
reason it is not satisfactory for frequent washing of type or printing
forms, though it is a good wash for inking rollers.</p>

<p>A weak lye, made from dissolved potash, was formerly used extensively
for washing type forms and inking rollers, but its use has been
superseded by the safer, cleaner, more convenient benzine or gasoline.
It is excellent, however, for washing type forms occasionally, as after
a long run on the press or after electrotype moulding, to clean off the
accumulation of dried ink or of moulder&rsquo;s wax and blacklead.</p>

<p>For cleaning with lye the form should be stripped of all wooden material
like reglets, wood-base plates, and anything that is liable to be
injured by the washing. The type should be placed on a board and set in
the sink. The washing is done with a medium stiff brush, care being
taken not to allow the hands to get wet with the lye, as the solution
will burn and discolor the skin. After a thorough but not hard rubbing,
the lye is rinsed off with running water until it has all disappeared.
If the type is still a little greasy to the touch after rinsing there is
still some lye to be cleared off by further rinsing.</p>

<p>Caustic soda may be dissolved and diluted to the right strength and used
in the same manner as potash lye.</p>

<h2 class="sechead"><a name="section_28" id="section_28"></a>Distributing Type</h2>

<p>The distribution of type and other material into the proper cases after
use is too often improperly done. It is important, if work is to be done
without waste of time, that the necessary materials should be where they
can be found quickly. A cleanly distributed case of type is necessary to
good typesetting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a href="images/p070.png" name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Page&nbsp;70]</a></span></p>

<p>A beginner should go at the work carefully. There are several matters,
as well as the lay of the case, with which he should become familiar. If
he is not perfectly familiar with every box he should have a diagram of
the case before him as a guide. He should take only one line at a time
in his hand, at the start, and only two or three types at a time between
his thumb and forefinger to drop in the boxes. Later, when he acquires
facility, he can take up a number of lines and take off complete words
to distribute.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img class="noborder w300" src="images/f070.jpg" width="300" height="332" alt="Holding type in the hand for distributing" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 20</p>
</div>

<p>The type line is placed in the left hand, well down in the palm&mdash;not
upon the ends of the thumb and finger. The nicks of the type should be
upwards and the face toward him. All words should be carefully spelled,
especially unfamiliar ones, before taking them from the line. In this
way the learner will note the b&rsquo;s and d&rsquo;s, p&rsquo;s and q&rsquo;s, u&rsquo;s and n&rsquo;s, A&rsquo;s
and V&rsquo;s. These letters are liable to be confusing at first, until one
gets used to the inverted appearance of the types.</p>

<p>The distributer must also note the slight difference in the capital I
and lower-case l, in the size of small capitals and lower-case letters,
and to distinguish between the o, s, w, v, x, z of the two sets of
alphabets. In some fonts the difference is so slight that experienced
compositors may not always be sure to distinguish

<span class="pagenum"><a href="images/p071.png" name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Page&nbsp;71]</a></span>

them, while other fonts have these six small capitals marked with an
extra nick. As a rule, the small capitals are larger and slightly
thicker than the round lower-case letters.</p>

<p>Fonts of old style figures have the figure

<img src="images/f071a.jpg" width="12" height="12" alt="Old-style 1" />

so near like the small capital <span class="smcap">i</span> that the difference can only be noted
by the thickness of the body; the figure is on an en set and the small
capital a little thinner. The lower-case o and the old style cypher

<img src="images/f071b.jpg" width="10" height="10" alt="old-style 0" />

are also easily confused. The cypher is usually rounder than the
lower-case letter.</p>

<p>The types should be dropped sidewise, with the face slightly upward, the
forefinger and second finger gently pushing the types apart as each is
dropped from the thumb and forefinger. Drop the type in its place
lightly, spelling the letters as they are dropped. If the type is large,
lay it in; do not throw it in face down. The eye should follow the hand
until it drops in the right box.</p>

<p>Special characters in the matter should be saved aside until the matter
is all distributed and then put where they belong. But do not put them
in the corner of a box and promise to care for them later. Types put out
of sight this way are usually forgotten. A small wooden galley or
shallow box kept in plain sight above the case is the best way to care
temporarily for extra characters, italics, and types that belong in
another case.</p>

<p>One of the most annoying things in a composing room is the distribution
of type into a case where it does not belong. This happens through
carelessness which should not be tolerated. To the beginner a constant
warning should be held up: Look sharp! Do not guess! Examine the nick as
well as the face. Do not be misled by a general appearance of
similarity. If there is any doubt about the types being returned to the
case where they belong, take a letter or two from the case and place it
beside a similar letter in the hand for close comparison.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a href="images/p072.png" name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Page&nbsp;72]</a></span></p>

<p>The distribution of advertisements and job work in which there are
several sizes and faces of type calls for extra care and a little system
in sorting out the lines before distribution. First select all the lines
of each kind on the galley, beginning with the large sizes, bringing all
the lines of one kind together for distribution at one time. This will
save extra steps, save time, and give fewer chances for distributing
into the wrong case.</p>

<p>If there is much type to distribute, take it to the case in a small
galley, such as a distributing galley or a typefoundry paging galley; or
bring the case to the stand where the work can be done conveniently and
correctly. Do not stoop down in a dark corner, or reach up to a case
above the level of the eyes, and distribute at a guess.</p>

<p>Distribute the different thicknesses of spaces in the boxes where they
belong. This should be the rule in all sizes under 24-point. The
3-spaces, 4-spaces, 5-spaces, and hair spaces should be kept separate,
so that they will not have to be sorted out when composition is done.</p>

<p>Pied type in any amount should not be distributed from the hand. Set the
letters in line in a composing stick, with nicks all one way, and then
distribute them in the usual way. If there are several sizes, pick out
the large ones first.</p>

<p>If there is only a little type in the case before beginning
distribution, this is a good time to clean out the boxes. Clean out the
space and quad boxes, sort out the few spaces there may be, pick out any
bits of card, paper, string, leads, broken type, etc. If the boxes are
dusty, blow them out with bellows or air pump, taking the case to a
place where the dust will be carried off and not go into the air to be
inhaled.</p>

<p>Neither before nor after distributing is it necessary to shake the type
case violently. Rattling the type around in the case usually injures the
face. A gentle

<span class="pagenum"><a href="images/p073.png" name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Page&nbsp;73]</a></span>

shake or two will be sufficient to spread out the few remaining types in
a nearly empty case or to settle down the types in a full case.</p>

<p>Thin leads and pieces of card or paper used in letter-spacing and
justification should not as a rule be left in the cases. If they are
worth saving and are likely to be used again they may be kept in a spare
box by themselves, not with some other spaces.</p>

<p>Small types in solid or leaded paragraphs are easier distributed if they
have been sponged with water a little time beforehand. If the types are
loose and dry, the water will hold them together slightly when handled.
If the matter has been standing for some time after washing and has
become caked or stuck together, it may have to be loosened up by a
thorough dampening which will get in between the types. New type is
liable to become caked together after standing and will need some soapy
water to make it distributable.</p>

capitals, headings, paragraph indentions, and similar matters. A style
card or style book may be prepared for the purpose by the proofreader or

one of several styles of early black-letter, as Old English Text, Priory
Text, etc.</dd>

<dt>Thick Space&mdash;</dt>
<dd>The en quad is sometimes so called. Some compositors call
the 3-space a thick space, ignoring the fact that the 3-space is normal,
neither thick nor thin.</dd>

<dt>Turn for Sorts&mdash;</dt>
<dd>When the types in a case run short and they will be
supplied later, the compositor puts in another type of the same
thickness, turned bottom up, the proper letter to be inserted before
printing or moulding. It is the rule, when a letter has been taken from
a live page to be used immediately in another place, that a turned
letter should be put in place of the one taken out to show the absence
of the proper letter when an impression is taken.</dd>

includes printing from engraved relief blocks which can be made up and
printed with composed types. Also called letterpress printing.</dd>

<dt>Underscore&mdash;</dt>
<dd>To draw or print a line under a word or sentence.</dd>

<dt>Unit&mdash;</dt>
<dd>An accepted standard of measurement; thus the point is the unit
for type sizes, the pica (12-point) is the unit for widths of pages,
lengths of leads, rules, furniture, etc.</dd>

<dt>Upper Case&mdash;</dt>
<dd>The capital case.</dd>

<dt>White Out&mdash;</dt>
<dd>To blank out a page or other space with quads or furniture.</dd>

<dt>Wide Measure&mdash;</dt>
<dd>Lines of type that are longer than normal in relation to
the size of type used; a length that would be normal for 12-point would
be wide for 6-point, Generally, lines averaging over twelve words or
fifty letters would be termed wide measure.</dd>

<dt>Wrong-font&mdash;</dt>
<dd>A letter or character in the line from another kind of type,
due to mixing of fonts. Usually written in proof&nbsp;<i>wf</i>.</dd>

<h2 class="s6">TYPOGRAPHIC TECHNICAL SERIES FOR APPRENTICES</h2>

<p class="s8 drop" style="z-index: 1;">THE
following list of publications, comprising the <span class="smcap">Typographic Technical
Series for Apprentices</span>, has been prepared under the supervision of the
Committee on Education of the United Typothetae of America for use in
trade classes, in course of printing instruction, and by individuals.</p>

<p class="s8 gappy">Each publication has been compiled by a competent author or group of
authors, and carefully edited, the purpose being to provide the printers
of the United States&mdash;employers, journeymen, and apprentices&mdash;with a
comprehensive series of handy and inexpensive compendiums of reliable,
up-to-date information upon the various branches and specialties of the
printing craft, all arranged in orderly fashion for progressive study.</p>

<p class="s8 gappy">The publications of the series are of uniform size, 5&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;8 inches. Their
general make-up, in typography, illustrations, etc., has been, as far as
practicable, kept in harmony throughout. A brief synopsis of the
particular contents and other chief features of each volume will be
found under each title in the following list.</p>

<p class="s8 gappy">Each topic is treated in a concise manner, the aim being to embody in
each publication as completely as possible all the rudimentary
information and essential facts necessary to an understanding of the
subject. Care has been taken to make all statements accurate and clear,
with the purpose of bringing essential information within the
understanding of beginners in the different fields of study. Wherever
practicable, simple and well-defined drawings and illustrations have
been used to assist in giving additional clearness to the text.</p>

<p class="s8 gappy">In order that the pamphlets may be of the greatest possible help for use
in trade-school classes and for self-instruction, each title is
accompanied by a list of Review Questions covering essential items of
the subject matter. A short Glossary of technical terms belonging to the
subject or department treated is also added to many of the books.</p>

<p class="s8 gappy">These are the Official Text-books of the United Typothetae of America.</p>

<p class="s8 gappy">Address all orders and inquiries to <span class="smcap">Committee on Education, United
Typothetae of America, Chicago, Illinois, U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;A</span>.</p>

<p class="s8 gappy1 drop">THIS
series of Typographic Text-books is the result of the splendid
co-operation of a large number of firms and individuals engaged in the
printing business and its allied industries in the United States of
America.</p>

<p class="s8 gappy">The Committee on Education of the United Typothetae of America, under
whose auspices the books have been prepared and published, acknowledges
its indebtedness for the generous assistance rendered by the many
authors, printers, and others identified with this work.</p>

<p class="s8 gappy">While due acknowledgment is made on the title and copyright pages of
those contributing to each book, the Committee nevertheless felt that a
group list of co-operating firms would be of interest.</p>

<p class="s8 gappy">The following list is not complete, as it includes only those who have
co-operated in the production of a portion of the volumes, constituting
the first printing. As soon as the entire list of books comprising the
Typographic Technical Series has been completed (which the Committee
hopes will be at an early date), the full list will be printed in each
volume.</p>

<p class="s8 gappy">The Committee also desires to acknowledge its indebtedness to the many
subscribers to this Series who have patiently awaited its publication.</p>
